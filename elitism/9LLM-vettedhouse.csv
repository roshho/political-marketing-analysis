Representative Strong serves on the House Appropriations Committee, where he is on three key Subcommittees: Commerce, Justice, and Science, as Vice Chair; Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development; and Legislative Branch. Strong also serves as the Chairman of the Homeland Security Emergency Management and Technology Subcommittee.
Before going to Washington, DC, Strong served as the Chairman of the Madison County Commission, the second-largest county in the state. He served in local government for 26 years, starting as the youngest Republican elected official in Alabama and eventually earning the title of Madison County CommissionÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first-ever Republican chairman.
Strong took a business-minded approach to local government. He reduced the county workforce, improved department efficiency, and implemented sound financial managementÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwithout raising taxes. Stro

A true public servant, Strong has spent his entire adult life as a committed first responder. Starting as a junior volunteer firefighter and 911 dispatcher, Strong has 35 years of service as an EMT and 41 years as a volunteer firefighterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and he still answers calls to this day.
He has been married to Laura Toney Strong for 25 years and has two children: Whitney and Harrison. The family attends Mt. Zion Baptist Church, the same church Strong attended as a child.

She is one of the first women elected to Congress from Alabama in her own right and the first Black woman to ever serve in the Alabama Congressional delegation.  
Congresswoman Sewell sits on the exclusive House Ways and Means Committee, bringing her more than 15 years of experience as a securities and public finance attorney. In the 119  
th  
Congress, she was selected to serve as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Oversight, making her the first Black woman to hold a leadership role since the Committee was established in 1789.  
Congresswoman Sewell also sits on the Committee on House Administration where she serves as Ranking Member of the Subcomm

ittee on Elections.  
During her time in Congress, Sewell has held several leadership positions including Freshman Class President in the 112th Congress. In the 119th Congress, she was selected by the Democratic Whip Katherine M. Clark to serve as a Chief Deputy Whip, and sits on the prestigious Steering and Policy Committee, which sets the policy direction of the Democratic Caucus.  
Congresswoman Sewell is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus where she is Chair of the Voting Rights Task Force. She is a member of the New Democrat Coalition; Co-Chair of the Congressional Voting Rights Caucus; Vice-Chair of the Congressional HBCU Caucus; and Co-Chair of the Rural Caucus.  
Congresswoman Sewell is an outspoken advocate for job creation, workforce development, skills training and for providing resources and economic opportunities for her constituents in the 7th Congressional District. In addition to pursuing job-creating legislation in Congress, Sewell has implemented a results-driven approach to addressing the unemployment crisis by hosting an Annual Job Fair and job readiness workshops.  
As the Member of Congress representing AlabamaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs civil rights district, Congresswoman Sewell has been a passionate champion for recognizing and honoring the sacrifices of those freedom fighters who served as powerful agents of change. Congresswoman Sewell was honored that her first piece of successful legislation recognized the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂFour Little GirlsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ who tragically lost their lives during the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in 1963. The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian honor Congress can bestow. The bill passed unanimously in both houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Barack Obama on May 24, 2013 in a signing ceremony in the Oval Office to commemor

ate the 50thÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Anniversary of the church bombing.
In March of 2015, Congresswoman Sewell welcomed the world to her hometown of Selma during the 50th Anniversary of the March from Selma to Montgomery including President and Mrs. Obama; President and Mrs. George W. Bush and more than 100 members of Congress. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ SewellÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs second Congressional Gold Medal bill to honor the Foot Soldiers of the Voting Rights Movement was signed by President Obama on March 7, 2015, the 50th Anniversary of Bloody Sunday.
Since the Supreme Court's disastrous
Shelby County v. Holder
decision in 2013 which gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), Congresswoman Sewell has been leading the charge to restore this critical law and ensure that every eligible American has a voice in our democracy. She is the author and lead sponsor of the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act which would restore the full protections of the VRA and prohibit states with a recent history of voter discrimination from restricting voting access.
Prior to her election in 2010, Congresswoman Sewell was the first Black woman partner in the Birmingham law office of Maynard, Cooper & Gale, P.C., where she distinguished herself as one of the only Black public finance lawyers in the State of Alabama.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ A proud product of AlabamaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs rural Black Belt, Congresswoman Sewell was the first Black valedictorian of Selma High School.

About

Born in Anchorage and raised by his maternal grandparents, Congressman Nick Begich embodies the spirit of Alaska. Nick grew up learning the values that make Alaska strong: self-reliance, honesty, and a deep-seated love for this land and its people. Today, he lives in Chugiak with his wife, Dharna, and their son Nicholas, continuing the tradition of raising the next generation of Alaskans on these same principles.
Nick pursued higher education in the Lower 48, graduating from Baylor University with a Bachelor of Business Administration in Entrepreneurship, and later completing his Master of Business Administration at Indiana University. His education equipped him with the skills to navigate the complex world of business. Recruited by Ford Motor Company, Nick sharpened these skills in a variety of roles, from technology to finance to product development; but the call of home was too strong.
In 2004, Nick and Dharna returned to Alaska, ready to give back to the state they love. Over the years, Nick has kickstarted numerous businesses, both within and beyond Alaska's borders. His business ventures have been built on innovation and industry. Nick's dedication doesn't stop at his own businesses - he has served as a startup coach and me

ntor, fostering the growth of early-stage companies and helping them thrive.
Nick has continuously invested in Alaska. His prior work with the Alaska Policy Forum, Club for Growth, and his years as a Board Director for Matanuska Telecom Association, show his commitment to public service and to Alaska's progress. Nick has seen firsthand the challenges Alaskans face, and he has the skills and experience to address these issues head-on.
Nick's goal in Congress is to make sure Alaskans succeed. His lifelong connection to this land, his passion for responsible business growth, and his belief in the power of hardworking Alaskan families make him the leader we need to take on Washington and deliver for Alaska.

High Chief Uifa'atali Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen
(Aumua Amata)
High Chief Uifa'atali Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen
(Aumua Amata), Republican, was elected as American SamoaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs third Member of Congress on November 4, 2014.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  She is the first woman to serve inÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the U.S. House of Representatives from American Samoa, theÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ first Republican woman of Samoan descent in Congress and the most senior Republican elected federal office holder of Asian Pacific heritage.
Committee Assignments
Congresswoman Amata serves on three committees. On the House Veterans Affairs Committee, she has a senior role as Vice Chairman of the full Committee, as well as Chairman of the Women Veterans Task Force. Within the Committee, she serves on two Subcommittees: The Subcommittee on Health, her top choice of assignments for the Veterans of American Samoa, along with the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which conducts oversight efforts regarding the VA.
She serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and two HFAC Subcommittee

s: The Subcommittee on the Indo-Pacific, on which she is Vice Chairman, and the Subcommittee on Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations.
Amata also serves on the House Natural Resources Committee and the two Subcommittees on HNR that are most directly related to American Samoa: The Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife, and Fishing, and the Subcommittee on Indian and Insular Affairs.
She also is Co-Chairman of the Indo-Pacific Task Force.
Bipartisan Legislative Efforts
In a major bipartisan achievement, Congresswoman Aumua Amata Radewagen has consistently ranked highlyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ in bipartisan activity as measured by sponsoring and co-sponsoring bills with those of the opposite party, according to an independent index that examines bipartisanship in Congress. The Bipartisan Index, developed by Georgetown University and the Lugar Center, tracks how frequently a Member sponsors and co-sponsors bipartisan bills, and most recently ranked Amata 19th among all the 441 House Members of the 117th Congress in 2021.
In 2017, the Congresswoman introduced, then Congress passed and President Trump signed into law, her legislation naming the American Samoa Veterans Clinic in honor of her predecessor, the late Congressman Eni F.H. Faleomavaega, and Vice President Mike Pence accepted her invitation to preside over the designation ceremony in a historic visit to American Samoa.
In late 2017, she was effective in having the American Samoa Economic Development Credit (ASEDC) passed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a provision that fosters economic growth and investment as well as stabilizes employment for the nearly 3,000 workers in the American Samoa tuna industry workforce.
In early 2018, the Congresswoman was successful in passing the content and key provisions of her b

ill, H. R. 385, as part of larger legislation, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (S. 2155). The measure will protect local American Samoan banking customers from unreasonable delays in check deposits and transfers, making these banking services timely and equitable to people throughout the rest of the U.S.
In 2019, a nonpartisan analysis by Yale Law School and associated Veterans groups determined that Congresswoman Amata led the entirety of both the House and Senate in the percentage of women nominated to Military Service Academies, as the only Member topping 50 percent female nominees in a balanced track record of nominations.

About
David Schweikert is serving his eighth term in the United States Congress.  He holds a seat on the Ways and Means Committee and is the current Chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee. He is the Chairman of the bicameral Joint Economic Committee, Chairman the Valley Fever Task force, is the Republican Co-Chair of the Blockchain Caucus, Co-Chair of the Tunisia Caucus, and Co-Chair of the Telehealth Caucus.
Among his legislative accomplishments, David was instrumental in authoring and passing H.R. 1. the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reformed an outdated tax code resulting in incredible economic growth, millions of jobs being created, 50-year record low unemployment, and increased revenues. David also played a key role in advancing the United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement (USMCA) as a Member of the Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee and USMCA Whip Team, working across the aisle to garner support. This 21st Century trade deal supports over 228,000 jobs, improves ArizonaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs cross-border trade relationships, and updates our inte

llectual property laws. David also played a crucial role in the formation of the most recent tax package, the  
Tax Relief for American Families & Workers Act  
, which secures pro-growth tax policies, including immediate research and development (R&D) expensing. Additionally, it incorporates interest deductibility, supporting small- and medium-sized businesses in meeting payroll and fostering growth. It further enables 100% expensing for business investments in U.S. facilities, equipment, and machines, while eliminating double taxation for businesses and workers operating in both the U.S. and Taiwan. Overall, this legislation solidifies over $600 billion in proven pro-growth tax policies, benefiting more than 21 million jobs. Essentially, according to staff on the Joint Committee on Taxation, the provisions nearly pay for themselves.  
During the 115th and 116th Congress, David helped advance several healthcare proposals designed to give patients the choice, affordability, and quality they deserve. His work as Co-Chair of the Telehealth Caucus proved pivotal in passing flexibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. He is also an advocate of H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, legislation compromised of bipartisan solutions designed to lower out of pocket spending, encourage innovation, improve transparency, and foster competition. David continues to advocate for permanently removing barriers to telehealth, developing a Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program, and providing patients with the most affordable care. David has always been a leader in the financial services space, previously serving on the House Financial Services Committee. During the 117th Congress, David re-introduced The Fair Investment Opportunities for Professional Experts Act, legislation he wrote to expa

In August 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission voted to modernize the definition of an accredited investor, incorporating many of the changes from DavidÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs legislation.
A national leader on tribal policy, David draws on a unique background working with ArizonaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs tribal communities on important priorities.
As a strong advocate for efficiencies in the 21st Century economy, David collaborates with entrepreneurs and innovators in Arizona and around the world on ways to increase trade and drive economic growth. David has long championed technological innovations as the solution to the problems of over-burdensome government regulations. He has been a lifelong champion of healthcare innovation, which is expected to save the healthcare industry and consumers money in the long-term.
In addition to chairing the Oversight Subcommittee, David holds a seat on the Tax and Social Security Subcommittees on the House Ways and Means Committee, where he is able to use his expertise in tax and retirement policy to lend his voice towards pressing issues such as meaningful tax reform and protecting and preserving Social Security and Medicare for future generations.

Privilege
of Serving as the U.S. Representative for
ArizonaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Second Congressional District.
A week after the September 11th attacks, Rep. Crane left college during his senior year at the University of Arizona to enlist in the U.S. Navy.

Congressman Juan Ciscomani represents ArizonaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 6th Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives. Juan and his family immigrated to the United States when he was a young boy. They established roots in Tucson, Arizona, where his father worked as a bus driver to give his children a shot at the American Dream. Growing up in a working class family taught Juan the value of hard work and the importance of a can-do attitude.
Juan attended public schools in Tucson, Pima Community College and the University of Arizona. He worked his way through school with maintenance and service jobs until becoming the first in his family to graduate from college. After college, Juan worked for the University of Arizona and the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce before joining Arizona Governor Doug DuceyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs administration as Senior Advisor and Vice-Chair of the Arizona-Mexico Commission. Juan focused on the issues of international trade and diplomacy, border security, and economic development.
In 2022, Juan was elected to represent ArizonaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs new 6th congressional district, becoming the first naturalized American citizen from Mexico elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in Arizona history.

Juan often shares a conversation with his dad where his dad asked him:
ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂWhere else could we have our story? We come to the US, learn English, immerse in the culture, become US citizens, I drive a bus most of my life, and now my son is a United States Congressman. Where else in the world? Nowhere else, thatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs the American Dream.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
Juan is determined to fight to keep that dream alive for others.
Juan resides in Tucson with his wife, Laura, and their 6 kids.

Growing up in ArizonaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 8th Congressional District, Congressman Abraham J. Hamadeh has the privilege of serving as the United States Representative for the community that built him.
Starting from humble beginnings as a first generation American, he remembers the feeling of moving into his first home on Happy Valley Road and 67th Avenue and realizing his family had achieved the American Dream.
ThatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs what led him to a career dedicated to public service - always fighting to keep the American Dream alive.
As a Maricopa County Prosecutor ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ he locked up criminals, protected victimsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ rights, and fought for justice.
As a former U.S. Army Reserve Captain and Intelligence Officer ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ he protected Arizonans overseas by vetting terrorist threats following the 2019 Pensacola terrorist attack.
Congressman Hamadeh's dedicated service to our country and commitment to protecting the most vulnerable paved the way for him to serve on the House Armed Services Committee and the House VeteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Affairs Committee.
Through his service on each committee, Congressman Hamadeh will ensure our warfighters are protected overseas and taken care of when they return home.
As the son of immigrant parents, who fled some of the worldÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs most oppressive regimes, Congressman Hamadeh is committed to keeping the flame of freedom burning bright by fighting f

About Rick
Biography
Raised in an Air Force family, U.S. Representative Rick Crawford has lived all over the United States and in England. His parents instilled in him a devotion to service from a young age. Those simple life lessons have remained with Rick, and are at the forefront of his mind when working on creating a more prosperous America for future generations.
Rick serving in Pakistan, 1988
Rick enlisted in the United States Army straight out of high school. He served as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician, completing four years of service and advancing to the rank of Sergeant. He earned numerous medals for service at home and in Southwest Asia.
After completion of his military service, Rick matriculated at Arkansas State University in Jonesboro and graduated in 1996 with a degree in Agriculture Business and Economics.
Crawford, an Arkansas State University graduate, visits with the Israeli Minister of Agricultural & Science Affairs at ASU.
Throughout college, Rick competed in rodeos across the country and, while recovering from a career-ending injury, discovered a talent for announcing and producing rodeos. He became a freelance rodeo announcer and producer after completing his bachelorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree, which led to a career in agri-news reporting and broadcasting. He founded and operated the AgWatch Network ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a web-based farm news content provider serving more than 50 radio station affiliates in five states. Rick also served as marketing manager for one of the largest John Deere dealer groups in North America.
Driven by a desire to serve and help secure a brighter future for ArkansasÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs First District, Rick decided to run for Congr
---
---
ess in 2010. In his seven terms in Congress, Rick has voiced the concerns of his district while bringing solutions to the national table. He is a senior member on the House Agriculture Committee, having played a critical role in passing two Farm Bills, having served on the Conference Committees in 2014 and 2018, and as Chairman of Agriculture Subcommittees in three of his first five terms in Congress. He views agriculture as a national security issue ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a nation that cannot feed itself is a nation that is not secure.
Crawford listens to testimony during a House Agriculture Committee hearing.
National security is one of RickÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs top priorities and he was appointed in 2017 to serve on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the first Arkansas representative to do so.
Rick also serves on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee where he has worked to create safer and more reliable highways, waterways, railways, and runways. His most significant accomplishment on the transportation front for the First District was the interstate designation of I-555, a vital corridor for Northeast Arkansas. He is current Chairman of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit after serving two terms as the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials.

Rick and his wife Stacy, also an A-State graduate, live in Jonesboro with their two children. In his spare time he enjoys spending time with his family, cooking, watching old western films, and playing guitar and singing with his band, Triple Nickel.

ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ She led House Democrats for 20 years and previously served as House Democratic Whip.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  In 2013, she was inducted into the National WomenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Hall of Fame at a ceremony in Seneca Falls, the birthplace of the American womenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs rights movement.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ In 2024, she was awarded by Pres

ident Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs highest civilian honor.
Pelosi has represented San Francisco in Congress for 37 years.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Currently serving as Speaker Emerita of the House and as the Representative for CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 11th Congressional District, she is
fighting For The People to lower costs, grow paychecks and create jobs.
Under the Biden-Harris Administration, Speaker Pelosi led the House in crafting and enacting the American Rescue Plan.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  This life-saving legislation turned the tide of the pandemic: getting vaccines into hundreds of millions of AmericansÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ arms, delivering direct assistance to families in need, creating millions of new jobs, supporting teachers, police officers, firefighters, transit workers and other frontline heroes, and returning children safely to schools.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Speaker Pelosi also engineered House passage of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which is strengthening roads, bridges, ports, water systems and broadband access in communities across the country while rebuilding AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs middle class.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Her leadership on the House-passed Build Back Better Act paved the way for the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act: historic action to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, lower health care premiums, deliver the most consequential climate action in human history and pay down the federal deficit.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Pelosi was a key negotiator in assembling the bipartisan and bicameral CHIPS and Science Act, which is powering America to world leader status in semiconductor production and scientific discovery, while building a diverse and inclusive STEM workforce in communities across the country.
In the 111th Congress, Speaker Pelosi led the House passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to rescue the nation from

 the depths of the financial crisis, helping create or save millions of American jobs.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Her leadership in enshrining the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law helped restore the ability of women to fight pay discrimination in the courts and ensure they too could participate in the economic recovery.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Pelosi also led the Congress in enacting the historic Dodd-Frank reforms to rein in big banks and create strong protections for consumers, seniors and Servicemembers.
Speaker Pelosi has long been a champion for familiesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ health care.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Pelosi was the architect of the landmark Affordable Care Act, which has guaranteed protections for all Americans with pre-existing medical conditions, forbid insurers from treating being a woman as a pre-existing condition, ended annual and lifetime limits on health coverage, and provided affordable health coverage for tens of millions more Americans.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  As Democratic Leader in 2017, Pelosi led the charge to defend American families from RepublicansÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ monstrous ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂTrumpcareÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ legislation: mobilizing a massive nationwide campaign in support of the ACA and powering Democrats back into the Majority in 2018.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  For decades, Pelosi has also been a relentless leader on reducing the costs of prescription drugs by empowering the federal government to negotiate drug prices and capping out-of-pocket costs for seniors: action enshrined into law in the Inflation Reduction Act.
Pelosi has made the climate crisis the flagship issue of her Speakership.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  In 2022, Speaker Pelosi delivered House passage of the Inflation Reduction Act ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ which contained the biggest, boldest climate action in history.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  This law included many House-crafted provisions to accelerate AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs transition to a clean energy future: putting the nation on a path to slash carbon pollution by 40 pe

rcent by 2030, while creating millions of new jobs and advancing environmental justice.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  This builds on progress from PelosiÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first Speakership: in 2007, she enacted comprehensive energy legislation that raised vehicle fuel efficiency standards for the first time in three decades and made a game-changing commitment to AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs homegrown biofuels.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  In 2009, she led passage of the American Clean Energy and Security Act to create clean energy jobs, combat the climate crisis and transition America to a clean energy economy.
A leader on conservation and the environment at home and abroad, Pelosi authored legislation to create the Presidio Trust and transform San FranciscoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs former military post into an urban national park.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  She also secured passage of the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂPelosi AmendmentÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ in 1989, now a global tool used to assess the potential environmental impacts of development.
Speaker Pelosi has been a force for accountability, transparency and participation in government.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Under her leadership, the House enacted the toughest ethics reform legislation in the history of the Congress ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ including the creation of an independent ethics panel.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Pelosi also led an historic legislative campaign for voting rights, passing two once-in-a-generation pieces of legislation.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  The For The People Act would expand access to the ballot, clean up corruption in government, outlaw partisan gerrymandering and combat dark money in politics, and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would restore the federal governmentÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs power to defend access to the ballot across the country.
Speaker Pelosi is a steadfast defender of the Constitution and the rule of law.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  In 2019, after President Trump violated his oath of office by soliciting foreign intervention in the upcoming presidential election and withhold

ing Congressionally appropriated assistance to Ukraine, the Democratic House launched an investigation that resulted in the third presidential impeachment in history.  In 2021, after President Trump incited a violent insurrection targeting the U.S. Capitol and sought to overturn the results of the election, the House impeached Trump a second time.  Speaker Pelosi then led the House in creating the bipartisan Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol.
Pelosi has been a staunch champion of AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs national security and a respected voice abroad in promoting democratic values.  She is the longest-serving Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in history: serving from 1993-2003, including as Ranking Member from 2000-2003, and continues to serve in an
ex officio
capacity.  As Speaker, she marshaled billions of dollars in security, economic and humanitarian assistance for the people of Ukraine after RussiaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs unlawful invasion in February 2022.  She orchestrated an overwhelmingly bipartisan and bicameral effort to impose swift and severe consequences on Russia, including a ban on the import of Russian energy and the revocation of normal trade relations.
For decades, Pelosi has offered a powerful voice for human rights around the world ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ especially speaking out on behalf of Uyghur communities, the citizens of Hong Kong, the Tibetan people and all those oppressed by the government of China.  In 2022, she became the first House Speaker and highest-ranking U.S. official to travel to Taiwan in a quarter-century: an historic visit that reaffirmed AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs unwavering support for the people of Taiwan.  As Democratic Leader, she helped strengthen AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs security by securing the votes needed to defeat RepublicansÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ ef

fort to disapprove of President ObamaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Iran Nuclear Agreement, a landmark policy that halted IranÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs progress toward a nuclear weapon.
Speaker Pelosi has long been a leader in the fight for full equality.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  She spearheaded the historic repeal of the discriminatory ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂDonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt Ask, DonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt TellÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ policy, allowing gay and lesbian Americans to openly serve their country.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  She passed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a law advancing justice for the millions of Americans at risk of violence for being who they are.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  As Speaker, she twice passed the watershed Equality Act: ensuring justice for the LGBTQ community in the workplace and in every place.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Pelosi also led the charge to fight back against the Trump AdministrationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs hateful ban on transgender Servicemembers.
While serving as Democratic Leader, PelosiÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs strength at the negotiating table wrested critical legislative victories out of the GOP majority.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  In the 114th Congress, she achieved an historic bipartisan agreement to strengthen Medicare: ending the cycle of expensive ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂDoc FixÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ patches and building a system that improves accuracy of payments and quality of care.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  She also delivered significant funding increases for key Democratic priorities, including the fight against the opioid epidemic, support for NIH medical research and permanent authorization of the World Trade Center Health Program.
Negotiating directly with the Trump Administration, Speaker Pelosi was crucial to securing vital relief for families and small businesses in early COVID-19 pandemic relief laws.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Additional key accomplishments signed into law during her four terms as Speaker include: landmark gun violence prevention measures; legislation to expand educational opportunities while reforming the financial aid system; legisla

Pelosi comes from a strong family tradition of public service.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Her late father, Thomas DÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂAlesandro Jr., served as Mayor of Baltimore for twelve years, after representing the city for five terms in Congress.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Her brother, Thomas DÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂAlesandro III, also served as Mayor of Baltimore.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  She graduated from Trinity College in Washington, D.C.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  She and her husband, Paul Pelosi, a native of San Francisco, have five grown children and ten grandchildren.

Meet Eric
Image
It's not something Democrats typically say about themselves, but Congressman Eric Swalwell was raised by Republicans.
His father was a cop, and his mother ran a small business. They brought him into the world in Sac City, Iowa, then raised him in Dublin, California, the oldest of four boys. His childhood was about family, sports, and hard work ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ from running a paper route at the age of 10, to sanding and inst

alling window frames as a teenager. A Division One soccer scholarship allowed him to become the first in his family to go to college.  
While attending the University of Maryland as an undergrad, Eric served as an intern on Capitol Hill for Representative Ellen Tauscher. After graduating from the University of Maryland School of Law, he became a prosecutor in the Alameda County District AttorneyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Office, where he led the Hate Crimes Unit. In 2010, Eric was elected to be a city councilmember in his hometown of Dublin.  
This experience served as perfect preparation for representing the people of CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 14th Congressional District in the East Bay.  
As a representative in Washington, Eric served eight years on the House Intelligence Committee where he was the chairman and ranking member overseeing the CIA. On the Intelligence Committee, Eric helped lead the House Investigation into RussiaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs interference in the 2016 election, and later, the first and second impeachments of Donald Trump. As a member of the House DemocratsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ leadership team, Eric was on the House Floor on January 6. A week after the attack, Eric was appointed as a House Impeachment Manager for the former presidentÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Senate trial.  
Eric currently serves on the House Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees. He is also Chairman Emeritus and founder of Future Forum, a group of young Democratic members focused on issues and opportunities for millennial Americans. Eric is also founder and co-chair of the bipartisan Critical Materials Caucus, and Personalized Medicine Caucus. Every day Eric strives to make sure if you work hard it adds up to doing better for yourself and dreaming bigger for your family.

About
A 4th Generation Californian & San Mateo County Native
Kevin Mullin is
proud
to be representing CA-15 in the U.S. House of Representatives, to
defend
our democracy,
strengthen
climate resilience, and
build
an economy that works for everyone.
KevinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs passion for civic engagement and democracy started early. As the son of a high school government teacher and a mother who enjoyed lively discussion at the dinner table, Kevin learned early that civic engagement and being an active participant in the political process gives you a voice in your local, state and federal government.
Early Life
As a senior in high school, Kevin participated in the Close-Up program where he first visited the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs capital, as well as the City of South San FranciscoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Youth in Government Day program (founded by his father Gene Mullin) providing him and fellow students with the opportunity to see first-hand the inner workings of local government. Later in life, he participated in the program as an elected official and was reminded of the importance of engaging young people in their democracy.
His elected experience began as a member of
Here is the extracted text exactly as it is:

the City of South San Francisco City Council from 2007-2012, serving as Mayor in 2011. He then represented San Mateo County in the California State Assembly from 2012-2022, serving as the Speaker pro Tem from 2014 until his departure, making him the longest tenured Speaker pro Tem of the modern era.
As the #2 officer in the Assembly, Kevin was part of the leadership team and presided regularly over floor sessions. In this role, Kevin made rulings on parliamentary inquiries and helped ensure bi-partisan cooperation and civility during Assembly business.
During his Assembly tenure, Kevin had over 60 bills signed into law, many focusing on elections and democracy reform. He championed All-Vote-By-Mail elections, and was author of the landmark DISCLOSE Act as well as the Social Media DISCLOSE Act so voters can easily see who is actually paying for political advertisements on TV and social media.
Kevin is a champion for climate resiliency. He was one of the architects of the $3.7 billion climate resilience package, helped ensure funding was allocated for Caltrain electrification, and worked to ensure the creation of San Mateo CountyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs OneShoreline, the agency that will help fight sea level rise and work to protect local, state, and federal assets and infrastructure.
I am proud to serve as your member of congress.
Kevin is also hard-of-hearing and wears hearing aids, and has been an advocate for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community, through consumer protection legislation.
Kevin served as an aide to his political mentor, former Congresswoman Jackie Speier when she was a state legislator. He has also been a local small communications business owner and television host and commentator.

He also studied leadership at HarvardÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Kennedy School of Government. Kevin is a passionate Bay Area sports fan and closely follows the Golden State Warriors, San Francisco 49ers and Giants, and his alma materÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs U.S.F.

About Zoe
Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren
Image
Zoe Lofgren has been a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives since 1995. She represents the18th District of California, which serves communities in Monterey, San Benito, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz counties.
A lifelong Bay Area resident and the daughter of a truck driver and a cafeteria cook and, later, a secretary. Zoe attended public schools and attended Stanford University on a California State Scholarship, graduating with a bachelor's degree in political science in 1970. Prior to attending Stanford, Lofgren worked the night shift at the Eastman Kodak plant in Palo Alto to save money for non-tuition college expenses not covered by her scholarship. After graduating from Stanford, she attended Santa Clara University School of Law with the help of a scholarship, graduating cum laude in 1975. She served as a member of Congressman Don Edwards' staff for eight years in both his San Jose and Washington DC offices from 1970 to 1978. She practiced and taught immigration law, and was a founder 
---
and first executive director of the nonprofit Community Housing Developers. She was first elected to the San Jose Evergreen Community College Board in 1979. In 1980, she was elected to the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, where she served for 14 years. Following Congressman Don Edwards' retirement in 1994 after 32 years in Congress, Zoe was elected to the House of Representatives.
She is currently the Ranking Member of the
House Science, Space and Technology Committee
and serves on the
House Judiciary Committee
. Zoe is also the elected Chair of the California Democratic Congressional Delegation. It is the most diverse delegation in the House and outnumbers all other state House delegations.
IMMIGRANT RIGHTS LEADER
Zoe is known for her steadfast advocacy for immigrant communities and her expertise on U.S. immigration law and policy. She led Democrats on the House Immigration and Citizenship Subcommittee during eight consecutive sessions of Congress. During the 116th Congress, Zoe led a group of bipartisan lawmakers in negotiations that resulted in the
Farm Workforce Modernization Act
ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a comprehensive agricultural workforce reform bill that provides a path to legal status for an estimated 1.5 million farmworkers and improves the H-2A temporary agricultural visa program. The legislation was negotiated with input from farmers, agricultural stakeholders, labor organizations, and farmworker advocates. The sensible compromise is fully supported by the United Farmworkers of America and growers. The bill passed the House with overwhelming support in both the
116th
and
117th
Congresses. Zoe has consistently sought to cut through the divisive political rhetoric to advance commonsense immigration policy solutions, including efforts to
address family-sponsored and employme
---
nt-based immigrant visa backlogs
and to create a
new visa program for immigrant entrepreneurs
.
She is also a champion of top-to-bottom immigration reform, and her leadership includes extensive efforts during the 113th Congress as part of an
eight-person bipartisan House working group
and an original cosponsor and advocate for the
U.S. Citizenship Act
in the 117th Congress. Additionally, throughout her tenure in Congress, and especially during the Trump Administration, Zoe led colleagues in addressing a multitude of immigration-related crises, including increased instability in the
Northern Triangle region
, and calling out constitutional and other abuses of power, including
Trump's Muslim travel ban
, the
Migrant Protection Protocols (""Remain in Mexico"" policy
), and the
""Zero Tolerance"" policy
that resulted in the separation of children from their parents at the border. Zoe also shepherded House passage of the
American Dream and Promise Act
for Dreamers and TPS and DED recipients, has been a constant advocate for those requiring humanitarian protection (including by promoting TPS for
Ukraine
,
El Salvador
,
Haiti
,
Liberia
,
Cameroon
, and
Lebanon
), and has worked to improve and safeguard institutions so immigrants receive humane treatment, benefits, fairness, and due process.
FOCUSED ON INNOVATION AND TECH POLICY
Zoe is also known for her work on patent reform, copyright issues, internet privacy, digital rights, and net neutrality. She successfully fought to initiate the
""e-rate""
that provides affordable internet access for schools, libraries, and rural health centers, and she led a bipartisan effort in the House to
decontrol encryption technology
. A staunch advocate for digital rights, Zoe was the lead early opponent of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and
led a 
---
---
successful fight to stop the bill in the House Judiciary Committee
. In 2014, Zoe
successfully spearheaded a bipartisan effort to close backdoor loopholes on unwarranted government surveillance
, and in early 2020, she led
bicameral reform efforts to protect Americans' civil liberties during FISA reauthorization negotiations
. In the 116th Congress, along with Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, Zoe introduced the 132-page
Online Privacy Act
, sweeping legislation that creates user rights, places obligations on companies to protect users' data, establishes a new federal agency to enforce privacy protections, and strengthens enforcement of privacy law violations.
As the top Democrat on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, Zoe is focused on
spurring innovation, fostering scientific advancement, and cultivating the nation's STEM pipeline
. She specifically plans to push Congress and the Administration to double down and accelerate research on
fusion energy
and, using her on-the-ground California expertise, work to
bolster the federal scientific agenda on wildfires

LaMalfa has been a strong advocate for limited, constitutionally grounded government, fiscal restraint, and lower taxes. He has worked to protect families from overregulation, ensure American farmers and ranchers can continue to feed the world, and has focused recovery from natural disasters.

He was instrumental in passing landmark laws such as the Affordable Care Act to reduce barriers to healthcare, the PACT Act to expand VA healthcare and benefits for veterans exposed to toxic substances, and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the largest investment in our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs infrastructure since the 1950s.

A long-time champion of CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs High-Speed Rail project, Costa authored legislation that created the CHSRA and got this project off the ground. He also secured major funding to widen Highways 41 and 99 and modernize regional public transportation systems.
As a senior member of the House Agriculture Committee, he has crafted three Farm Bills and has worked across the aisle to reduce hunger and uplift rural America. Costa has been a strong advocate for bringing additional water to the San Joaquin Valley and secured funding for water infrastructure projects such as B.F. Sisk Dam, Friant-Kern Canal, and Sites Reservoir.
Costa is a staunch defender of democratic principles at home and around the world.
On the Foreign Affairs Committee, he has worked with each Congress to pass a resolution recognizing the Armenian Genocide and is a strong supporter of Israel as a vital partner of the United States in the Middle East.
Costa supports a strong posture towards Iran - he was a conference committee member negotiating the
Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010
, which invoked the first significant U.S. sanctions on Iran.
Costa was principal in securing Congressional approval to keep FresnoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 144th Air National Guard Fighter Wing viable well into the future.
An outspoken advocate for Ukraine, he visited the capital city of Kyiv a few months after the invasion. In Congress, he has voted to provide weapons, military equipment, economic assistance, and humanitarian aid to help the Ukrainian government defend its people and sovereignty, as well as democracy around the world.

Congressman David G. Valadao Biography
Congressman David G. Valadao was born and raised in Hanford, California in the center of the agriculturally rich Twenty-Second Congressional District. As a lifelong resident of the Central Valley, he has been active in agriculture and dairy industry groups, as well as many local charities.
The Valadao family emigrated from the Azores Islands of Portugal to the United States in 1969. After settling in the Central Valley, ValadaoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs father started a small dairy farm in the Central Valley in 1973. Valadao was born on April 14, 1977.
The family business now consists of two dairies, as well as over 1,000 acres of farmland in Kings and western Tulare County, on which Valadao and his famil

y grow almonds, alfalfa, corn, and wheat as dairy feed stock.
Intimately involved in the dairy industry, Valadao has taken on leadership roles within the California Milk Advisory Board, and Western States Dairy Trade Association. In addition, he was elected as Regional Leadership Council Chairman for Land OÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Lakes, Inc.
Valadao attended local schools, graduating from Hanford High School in 1995 and later attended the College of the Sequoias in Visalia. Valadao married his high school sweetheart, Terra, in 1999. Together, they have three beautiful children.
In 2010, Valadao was elected to represent CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 30th State Assembly District. Valadao served on several California Assembly Committees including the Agriculture Committee, where he held the position of Committee Vice-Chair.
In 2012, Valadao was elected to represent CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 21st Congressional District, which included Kings County and portions of Fresno, Kern, and Tulare Counties. Valadao represented the 21
st
District in Congress from 2013-2018. In 2020, Valadao was elected to return to Washington to serve in the House of Representatives. Due to redistricting, Rep. Valadao was reelected to serve his fifth term in the U.S. House of Representatives as the representative for California's 22nd Congressional District, which includes Kings, Kern, and Tulare Counties.
In all of Rep. Valadao's five terms in Congress, Valadao has served on the influential House Appropriations Committee, which is the committee responsible for funding the federal government and determining where American tax dollars are spent.
Since he came to Congress, Valadao has established himself as a leader in agriculture and water policy, two important issues for his constituents in CA-22. His time in Congress has been focused on combating the 
---

water issues impacting CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Central Valley and ensuring Congress does everything in their power to provide relief for the farmers, families, and entire communities suffering from the ongoing water shortages due to drought and years of water mismanagement.
ValadaoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs work on the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Committee has fostered his interest in ensuring our active duty military members have the tools and services they need to defend our nation and keep Americans safe. Valadao worked hard to ensure Naval Air Station Lemoore was named the location for the U.S. NavyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Pacific Fleet of the F-35C aircraft. Valadao is also dedicated to keeping our promises to our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs veterans by making sure those who served our country are taken care of in their retirement years and receive the best quality healthcare available.

Congressman Salud Carbajal proudly represents the 24th Congressional District of California, which includes the entirety of Santa Barbara County and portions of San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties.
First elected to Congress in 2016, Congressman CarbajalÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs life experiences have helped him advocate for the needs of his constituents by fighting for economic opportunities for working families, environmental protections and investments in renewable energy, improvements to our immigration system, upgrades for our infrastructure and public safety, and commonsense fixes to lower costs of living like child care, health care, and housing.
Congressman Carbajal sits on the House Committee on Armed Services and the House Committee on Agriculture. He is also a senior member of the Ho

use Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, serving as the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation. From this role, in 2021 he helped write and pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ which has since delivered more than $1 billion for projects up and down the Central Coast and supporting more than 13,000 jobs.
Over his career in Congress, Congressman Carbajal has seen multiple of his bills signed into law, including bills to respond to the 2019 Conception boat fire off the Central Coast and a gun safety measure promoting the implementation of ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂred flagÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ laws inspired by the 2016 mass shooting in Isla Vista. He was also a key supporter of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, designated in 2024, which now protects more than 100 miles of California coastline and ecosystems as the third largest marine sanctuary in U.S. history.
His advocacy in Congress has also delivered more than $50 million in federal funding for a wide range of Central Coast projects, from upgrades for local health clinics and food banks to support for first responders and municipal police departments.
Congressman Salud Carbajal rose from humble beginnings. After emigrating from Mexico to the United States at age 5, Salud applied himself in school ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ working summers as a farmworker with his father ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ to become the first in his family to graduate from a university, earning a bachelorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree from the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB).

BrownleyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs work on behalf of women veterans has been a hallmark of her career. One of her signature accomplishments was passing the Female Veterans Suicide Prevention Act in 2016, which directs the VA to collect critical data on women veterans to improve suicide prevention. She also authored the Deborah Sampson Act, the most comprehensive legislation for women veterans in over a decade, which was signed into law in January 2021. Brownley continued this momentum by championing the Elizabeth Dole 21st Century Veterans Healthcare and Benefits Improvement Act, signed into law in December 2024, which includes two of her bills: the Elizabeth Dole Home Care Act and the Improving Whole Health for Veterans with Chronic Conditions Act.

ddition to her advocacy for veterans, Brownley serves on the
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
, where she is a member of the Subcommittee on Aviation, the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, and the Subcommittee on Water Resources. Brownley has been a strong advocate for local infrastructure improvements, particularly for Ventura CountyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ports, harbors, and airports. Recognizing the regionÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs critical role as an economic engine for both the state and the nation, Brownley has fought to secure federal funding for infrastructure projects that support job creation, economic growth, and safety. As a champion for the Port of Hueneme, Channel Islands Harbor, Ventura Harbor, and local airports, she has played a central role in helping secure the resources necessary to modernize these vital transportation hubs. Her work has promoted both job creation and revenue growth for the region, benefiting not only the local economy but also national and international trade.
Following her work on transportation, Brownley has made significant strides in advocating for environmental protections and addressing climate change. As a member of the
House Committee on Natural Resources
, Brownley has been a vocal advocate for preserving the natural beauty of Ventura County and safeguarding coastal and inland communities from the increasingly severe impacts of climate change. She has worked diligently to push for responsible land management, wildfire prevention, and increased funding for disaster recovery efforts.
Brownley has also been a tireless advocate for climate action, playing a key role on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. As a committee member, she contributed to the groundbreaking 2020 report that laid out a comprehensive action plan for a clean energ

y economy and a healthy, just America. Brownley continues to champion forward-thinking climate policies, including legislation to reduce food waste, curb harmful emissions, and invest in climate-resilient infrastructure.
Through her extensive work on key issues, Brownley has earned recognition as one of the most effective members of Congress, exemplifying her ability to turn legislative priorities into meaningful reforms. Her success is evident in her leadership on climate change, veteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ health care, infrastructure, and womenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs issues, creating meaningful policy reforms that have lasting impacts.
Before her time in Congress, Brownley served in the California State Assembly, where she played a key role on the Committee on Natural Resources and in implementing AB 32, CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs landmark Global Warming Solutions Act. For her environmental leadership, Brownley received the Environmental Champions Award from the Environmental Working Group and the Sierra Club Political Leadership Award.
BrownleyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs commitment to public service began in 1994 when she ran for her local school board to advocate for her daughter, who has dyslexia, and other students with special needs. She served on the school board for over a decade, working to improve public education for all students. She was elected to the California State Assembly in 2006, where she chaired the Assembly Education Committee and served on numerous education-focused panels, including the Higher Education Committee, Budget Subcommittee on Education Finance, and the State Allocation Board.
Brownley holds a B.A. in Political Science from George Washington University and an M.B.A. from American University. Before entering public service, she worked in private-sector marketing. She currently resides in Thousand Oaks, and is the

proud mother of Hannah, who works for an international aid organization, and Fred, a physician at the University of Colorado. Brownley is also a doting grandparent to her granddaughter, Tibby.

Meet Jared
Representative Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael) was sworn in as a member of the 113th Congress on January 3, 2013 to represent California's second district.
Jared Huffman represents California's 2nd Congressional District which spans the North Coast of the state, from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Oregon border, and includes Marin, Sonoma, Mendocino, Humboldt, Trinity, and Del Norte counties. He was first elected to Congress in November 2012 and currently serves on the Committee on Natural Resources and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In the 118th Congress, he serves as the Ranking Member of the Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife, and Fisheries with jurisdiction over federal water projects, fisheries management, coastal zone and oceans policy, and wildlife and endangered species. Jared also founded the Congressional Freethought Caucus, which he co-chairs, to promote sound pu
---
blic policy based on reason, science and moral values, while protecting the secular character of government and championing the value of freedom of thought worldwide.  
During his time in Congress, Jared has built a reputation as a progressive leader and an environmental expert who focuses on making a difference. Jared is also committed to ensuring our communities are resilient to the effects of climate change, including wildfires and droughts. He has been instrumental in defending America's coastlines from offshore oil and gas drilling, introducing legislation to protect the Pacific and Arctic Oceans as part of a coordinated, nationwide effort to protect oceanic ecosystems and coastal economies, while reducing our unhealthy dependency on fossil fuels.  
Jared is dedicated to serving the local needs of the 2nd Congressional District of California. From his very first term in Congress, he began pushing legislation that would foster economic opportunity, and protect the unique environmental and economic values of the North Coast including the rural and tribal communities of the district. This includes improving access to critical broadband to close the digital divide and increased funding for public schools and special education programs through his IDEA legislation. He has also fought to improve access to affordable housing options, even passing legislation to create badly-needed affordable housing in West Marin. During his first term in Congress, the House of Representatives unanimously passed Congressman Huffman's first bill as a U.S. Congressman to expand the California Coastal National Monument to include the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands, which led to permanent protection for this jewel of the Mendocino Coast. He has also worked to increase penalties for illegal ma
---
rijuana grows that damage our watersheds and jeopardize fragile ecosystems, and led the fight to protect marine mammals by calling for an end to orca captivity and designating thousands of miles for protected sanctuaries.
Jared is committed to finding bipartisan compromises and real solutions to pressing issues and reaches across the aisle to find common ground whenever possible. In February 2019, for example, Jared introduced two bipartisan pieces of legislation that provided additional protections to the environment: the bipartisan Still-In Resolution to reaffirm the America's commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Arctic Cultural and Coastal Plain Protection Act to defend the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from oil and gas drilling.
Before serving in Congress, Jared represented the North Bay for six years in the California Assembly where he chaired the Water, Parks and Wildlife Committee. Among his other accomplishments as a state legislator, Jared played a leading role in crafting landmark water reforms in 2009 and authored dozens of successful bills, including California's pioneering lighting efficiency standards (AB 1109) which were subsequently adopted into federal law; the nation's largest programs for solar hot water heating (AB 1470) and paint recycling (AB 1343); reforms that improve California's State Parks system (AB 1589) and Department of Fish and Wildlife (AB 2402); and creation of a new voluntary type of corporation, California Benefit Corporations, to promote corporate social responsibility (AB 361).
Prior to his legislative service, Jared worked as a Senior Attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). One of his proudest accomplishments at NRDC was helping forge an agreement to restore a 153-mile stretch of the San
---
---
Joaquin River in California's Central Valley. Before NRDC, Jared was a successful public interest attorney whose victories included several major jury verdicts in gender discrimination and race discrimination trials. He also served 12 years in local government as a Director of the Marin Municipal Water District (MMWD), from 1994 to 2006.
Jared graduated
magna cum laude
from U.C. Santa Barbara, where he was a three-time NCAA All-American volleyball player. He went on to play for the USA Volleyball Team in 1987 when the team was ranked #1 in the world, before attending and graduating
cum laude
from Boston College Law School. Jared lives in San Rafael with his wife Susan, a teacher. They have two children, Abby and Nathan. In his free time, Jared enjoys fishing, hiking, and playing tennis.

Biography
Rep. Friedman has lived in California for more than three decades. Currently, she lives in Glendale with her husband and daughter. Friedman proudly represents CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 30th District, which includes Burbank, Glendale, West Hollywood, and parts of Los Angeles and Pasadena.
Friedman is committed to making meaningful progress on the issues that matter most to her district: making housing more affordable, safeguarding access to clean water, protecting communities from wildfires and other disasters, and creating an economy that works for everyone.
Friedman serves on two key committees: the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.
Before joining Congress, Friedman represented the 44
th
district in the California State Assembly, where she built a reputation as a tireless advocate for the environment, housing, and transportation. During her time in the Assembly, she secured more than $60 million in funding for local projects like the Glendale Riverwalk, Griffith Park safety improvements, and upgrades to the Glendale Central Library. She also led the charge on landmark legislation to improve r
---
oad safety, invest in zero-emission vehicles, and promote water conservation.  
Laura got her start in the private sector working as a film and television producer after receiving her B.A. from the University of Rochester, New York. Building on her years of community service, Laura also served on the Glendale City Council and as the Mayor of Glendale.  
Laura was tapped for several leadership roles during her time in the state legislature, including the Chair of the Assembly Transportation Committee, Chair of the Assembly Natural Resources Committee, Assistant Speaker pro Tempore for the Assembly, Chair of the Assembly Select Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, the Assembly Select Committee on Urban Development to Combat Climate Change, and Chair of the Joint Rules Subcommittee on Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response where she led a historic bicameral and bipartisan reform of the legislatureÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs response to sexual harassment thatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs become a model for other states and local governments.  
From her days as a film and television executive to her years as a local leader in Glendale, Laura has always been about making an impact. Whether itÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs fighting for affordable housing, building sustainable communities, or ensuring her district is ready for the challenges of tomorrow, LauraÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs focus remains the same: delivering real solutions for the people she serves.

ona, is deeply committed to the Inland Empire. She lives there with her husband, Louis, and their two sons, Robert and Matthew. Her third son, Christopher, is a distinguished Air Force veteran and current law enforcement officer. Her family's support and her personal dedication to the community have been the driving force behind her career. She has consistently advocated for funding for community projects, public safety and introduced legislation to address the needs of Inland Empire residents.
Commencement of Political Career
As a State Senator, Torres made significant contributions to successfully implementing the Affordable Care Act for CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs patients and consumers. She diversified the Covered California Board and secured federal funds for the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂKeep Your Home CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ program. Torres also authored legislation to modernize the 9-1-1 system for improved emergency response. She started her public service career as a 911 dispatcher, where she led the fight to improve 911 service for the residents of Los Angeles. A member of the AFSCME union, she graduated from the National Labor College with a BA in Labor Studies.
Prioritizing Bipartisanship
Since 2015, Torres has been a beacon of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. With a lifelong background in public service spanning over two decades, she has repeatedly proven that she is committed to working across the aisle, working with Democrats and Republicans, and getting results for Inland Empire families. Her ability to bridge the political divide is a testament to her commitment to serving all her constituents.
Securing funding for the Inland Empire

She secured $73 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and passed over $863 million for bipartisan appropriation projects. Torres' priority is always meeting the needs of the people she serves, making every constituent feel valued and important.
Making a Difference Abroad
During her time in Congress, Torres has worked to protect democracy at home and abroad. As the only Central American-born Member of Congress, she successfully directed the Appropriations Committee to efficiently fund programs addressing the root causes of migration, cracking down on lawlessness and impunity by authoritarian leaders, preventing violence against women and children, and promoting human rights. The White House implemented her Central American Women and Children Act, the first compact signed between the United States and Honduras to address gender-based violence in Honduras and ensure the safety and well-being of vulnerable children and women in Central America.
Bringing CA35 Priorities to Capitol Hill
On the Appropriations Committee, Congresswoman Torres sets priorities for the needs of Inland Empire families. Following the unsolved murder of Inland Empire native Army Specialist Enrique Roman-Martinez, she used her role on the committee to pass her Enrique Roman-Martinez Military Cold Case Justice Act to reform how the military handles cold cases. Has requested additional funding to fund the Military Criminal Investigative Organizations (MCIOs), which are essential for solving murders, sexual assaults, rape, and other significant crimes against American

A former labor lawyer, Linda T. SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez represents CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 38th congressional district ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ but the first thing her family and friends will tell you is that sheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs never stopped ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂkicking ass for the working class.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Most of all, she is also a proud mom, dog lover, and Dodgers fan.
Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2002, SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez is the first Latina to serve on the powerful
House Committee on Ways and Means
and the House Judiciary Committee. A lifelong progressive, SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez has devoted her career to helping working people get ahead: advocating for families, improving AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs education system, and bringing jobs to Southern California.

ry school teacher who decided to further her education by attending school at night. Growing up in a proud Latino household, SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchezÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs parents inspired her to take advantage of the opportunities they never had.
When reflecting upon the importance that her family and parents had in her life, SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez says, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂIn every Latino family, thereÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs a sense of ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂWe need to stick together.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ But I think in our particular family, thatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs even stronger because our folks expected great things from us. They wanted us to take advantage of all the opportunities they never had.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
Legislative Record
Throughout her time in Congress, SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez has been a steadfast advocate for working people, including improving school safety; enabling more women, minorities, and veterans to establish small businesses; reforming the tax code to provide relief for long-term caregivers; bringing scrutiny to the misuse of arbitration that unfairly harms workers; and keeping families in their homes through changes to bankruptcy law. She has been a staunch advocate for
AlzheimerÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs beneficiary and caregiver
support, having lost her father and watching her mother suffer from the disease.
SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez currently serves on the House Committee on Ways and Means, where she advocates for the protection of Social Security and Medicare, fairness for U.S. workers and businesses in trade agreements, and an even playing field for the middle class through tax code reform. In 2024, she became the first Latina and woman of color to serve as a ranking member on a Ways and Means subcommittee. As an active member of that committee, the Congresswoman has championed many bills that have become law. Among her proudest achievements are a bill to assist small businesses in providing retirement benefits for their employees; enhanced customs enforceme

nt; as well as bills to improve mental health coverage related to opioid addiction recovery. She has fought to improve childcare funding options for working parents and remains committed to shoring up pension funding for workers across the county. SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez also proudly secured a parcel of land in Norwalk, California that formerly served as a tank farm property for her local community to redevelop.
In addition to co-founding the Congressional Labor and Working Families Caucus, SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez has also served in several leadership positions. From 2011 to 2017 (112thÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ114th Congresses), she was the Ranking Member of the House Ethics Committee. In the 114th Congress, SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez served as Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC). During the 115th Congress (2015ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ2017), SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez served as Vice Chair of the House Democratic Caucus. She is the first Latina elected to a leadership position in the U.S. Congress.
In addition to Ways and Means, she has also served on the following committees: Judiciary, Ethics, Oversight and Reform, Small Business, Education and Labor, Veterans' Affairs, Foreign Affairs, and the Select Committee on Benghazi.
As the only first-term Democrat to earn a seat on the Judiciary Committee during the 108th Congress (2003ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ2005), SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez sponsored measures to improve school safety. From her seat on the Small Business Committee, she worked to assist women, minorities, and veterans establish businesses. In 2008, as Chairwoman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law (CAL), SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez led an investigation into the politicization of the Department of Justice and another
investigation into the firing of nine U.S. attorneys
during the Bush administration.
In 2009,
SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez helped expose the dangers of concussions
in the National Football League
---
---
(NFL), which resulted in changes to how football teams and youth sports address concussions. During a Judiciary Committee hearing, SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez confronted NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for denying the link between football and cognitive decline saying, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂThe NFL has this blanket denial or minimizing of the fact that there may be this link. And it sort of reminds me of the tobacco companies pre-ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ90s when they kept saying, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂOh, thereÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs no link between smoking and damage to your health.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
From her seat on the Ways and Means Committee, Congresswoman SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez in 2016 introduced bipartisan legislation to provide tax deductions for caregivers who incur expenses for long-term care for spouses or other dependent relatives. In 2009, SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez introduced the
Gender Equity in Health Premiums Act
, to bar health insurance companies from charging women more for health care premiums than men. The
Gender Equity in Health Premiums Act
became part of the
Affordable Care Act
, which President Obama signed into law in 2010.
From 2014-2016, SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez served as a member of the Select Committee on Benghazi, which was formed to further investigate the Benghazi attack on September 1, 2012. She
spoke out
against the politicization and costliness of the committee, in which the final report found no new evidence of wrongdoing.
Making Herstory

AFL-CIO.
SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez attended the University of California, Berkeley, where she earned a BA in Spanish literature with an emphasis in bilingual education in 1991. After working her way through school as a bilingual aide and an ESL instructor, she went on to earn a law degree from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1995.
In 2002, SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives from a new working-class district created after the 2000 Census. At 34 years old, she was the
first woman IBEW member
elected to Congress. She and her sister Loretta, who was in the House from 1997 to 2017, are the first women of any relation to serve together in Congress.
SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez is one of the
few women to play in the Congressional Baseball Game
, where Democrat and Republican Members of Congress play against each other for charity. She was the only woman on the field for more than a decade and was awarded the DemocratÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs MVP award in 2015. A pinch-hitter, she wears ""IX"" as her number to represent Title IX, the landmark legislation that gave women equal opportunity in higher education and sports. In 2009, a Congressional WomenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Softball Game was started and SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez played on both teams for a few years, ultimately sticking with her true passion, baseball.
SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡nchez is the proud mom of JoaquÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ­n, born in 2009. She is only the
eighth woman in history to give birth
while serving in Congress. They live with their dog, Scully.

For more than twenty years, Mark Takano has worked to improve the lives of Riverside County residents, both as an elected official and as a teacher at Rialto High School.
Biography Image DC7F0F9B-E424-1DDD-B88F-3D322E384DDB

Born and raised in Riverside, MarkÃÂÃÂs commitment to public service began at an early age. His family roots in Riverside go back to his grandparents who, along with his parents, were removed from their respective homes and sent to Japanese American Internment camps during World War II. After the war, these two families settled in Riverside County to rebuild their lives.

Mark attended La Sierra High School in the Alvord Unified School District, and in 1979 he graduated as the schoolÃÂÃÂs valedictorian. Mark attended Harvard College and received his bachelorÃÂÃÂs degree in Government in 1983. As a student, he bussed tables to help make ends meet. During his senior year, he organized a transcontinental bicycle ride to benefit the international development agency Oxfam America.

Upon graduation, Mark returned home to Riverside and began teaching in the Rialto Unified School District in 1988. As a classroom teacher, Mark confronted the challenges in our public education system daily.

In 1990, Mark was elected to the Riverside Community College DistrictÃÂÃÂs Board of Trustees. At RCC, Mark worked with Republicans and Democrats to improve higher education for young people and job training opportunities for adults seeking to learn a new skill or start a new career. He was elected Board President in 1991 and helped the Board and the District gain stability and direction amid serious fiscal challenges.

In 2012, Mark became the first openly gay person of color to be elected to Congress.

Mark Takano represents the people of Riverside, Moreno Valley, Jurupa Valley and Perris in the United States House of Representatives. He serves as Ranking Member of the House Committee on VeteransÃÂÃÂ Affairs, and as a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee.

As former Chairman of the House Committee on VeteransÃÂÃÂ Affairs, Mark authored the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act, or the Honoring our PACT Act, comprehensive toxic exposure legislation that addresses the full scope of issues affecting toxic-exposed veteransÃÂÃÂ access to VA care and benefits. The Honoring our PACT Act expanded VA healthcare eligibility for over 3.5 million veterans exposed to burn pits, established a presumption of service connection for over 23 respiratory illnesses and cancers, and also eliminated the requirement that veterans prove exposure to toxic substances - a requirement that has often prevented many from accessing the care and benefits they have earned and deserve.

First elected in 2022, Congressman Kevin Kiley proudly serves the people of CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 3rd District. He is dedicated to using his position to promote fiscally sound policies to reduce inflation, increase choice in education, and responsibly manage our public lands to preserve our beautiful forests and prevent catastrophic wildfires.
The son of a special education teacher, Kevin grew up in the district, attended local public schools and graduated from Granite Bay High School. After college, he began his career as a 10th-grade English teacher at Manual Arts High School in inner-city Los Angeles, where he chaired the English Department, leading his students to significant academic gains and founding an award-winning speech and debate team. After graduating from law school, Kevin helped prosecute the civil case against ChinaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Huawei Technologies for intellectual property theft and defended the Constitution in California courts. Later, Kevin became a prosecutor and represented the people of California against violent felons as Deputy Attorney General.
Kevin was first elected to the California State Assembly in 2016, where he remained until being elected to Congress in 2022. Since coming to Congress, Rep. Kiley has been a champion for workersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ rights. He is leading the effort to overturn the Department of LaborÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs independent contractor ruling, which limits workersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ ability to choose when and where they want to work. Kiley has been a leader in bipartisan reforms as well. He introduced the PRESS Act, which the House passed with bipartisan support, to protect journalists from being compelled to disclos

e their sources. He led a successful effort to restore Medicare funding for senior programs and is working across the aisle on legislation to protect children from fentanyl.
A tireless advocate for his district, Kiley has supported over 25 projects worth over $70 million in federal grants to reduce traffic congestion, improve public safety, expand access to water resources, and protect our communities from fire. Since Kiley was sworn in, the Third Congressional District has received $200 million in federal grants. Beyond his support for programs and grants to benefit the district, Kiley has made constituent services a priority. Kevin and his team have closed over 2,300 constituent cases, each one representing a family or individual who needed help with a federal agency, and have returned over $7 million to those constituents.
Kevin holds a bachelorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree from Harvard, a law degree from Yale, and a masterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs in secondary education from Loyola Marymount. Kevin and his wife, Chelsee, reside in Roseville.

gressman Garcia championed the pro-housing movement in Congress to encourage the development of new housing units and bring down the cost of living across the nation. Congressman Garcia was instrumental in founding and launching the bipartisan Congressional Yes In My Back Yard (YIMBY) Caucus, aimed at promoting policies to increase the housing supply to address affordability and homelessness.
In the 118th Congress, two bills introduced by Congressman Garcia were signed by President Joe Biden into law. These bipartisan laws, aimed at improving government efficiency, will save taxpayer dollars and promote more accountable government operations.
As Caucus Leadership Representative, Congressman Garcia is a key figure in steering the direction and priorities of the Democratic Caucus in the U.S. House. Congressman Garcia communicates between party leadership and newer members to ensure that the voices of Representatives across the party are heard and represented in legislation.
Congressman Garcia is also the co-chair of the Congressional Ports Opportunity, Renewal, Trade, and Security (PORTS) Caucus and Peru Caucus. The PORTS Caucus advocates for port infrastructure, secure and resilient supply chains, and for our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs economy. The Peru Caucus aims to strengthen the relationship between the United States and Peruvian people by enhancing political dialogue and cooperation on shared values and principles.
Congressman Garcia was elected to represent CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 42nd Congressional District, including Long Beach and Southeast Los Angeles, in November 2022. Congressman Garcia previously served as the 28th Mayor of Long Beach from 2014 to 2022, and served on the City Council from 2009 to 2014.

th progressive education policy, addressing the climate crisis, supporting working families with increasing wages, and fighting to expand and protect essential rights for women, immigrants, and the LGBTQ+ community. In Congress, Congressman Garcia has championed legislation to tackle the affordable housing shortage, make our government run more efficiently, regulate ammunition sales to address our gun violence epidemic, reduce ocean shipping pollution, pandemic preparedness, and defend international human rights.
Congressman Garcia is proud to serve as the first openly LGBTQ immigrant in Congress. A self-admitted comic book nerd, Congressman Garcia credits comics with helping him learn to read and write English and has since channeled his love of popular culture into founding the Congressional Popular Arts Caucus, which celebrates the economic and cultural contributions of the popular arts.
Congressman Garcia immigrated from Peru to the United States as a young child and was raised in Southern California, and became a U.S. citizen in his 20's. He holds an M.A. from the University of Southern California and an Ed.D. in Higher Education from Cal State Long Beach, where he also earned his B.A. in Communications.

 Inglewood, Lawndale, Lomita and Torrance.
Congresswoman Waters made history as the first woman and first African American Chair of the House Financial Services Committee. An integral member of Congressional Democratic Leadership, Congresswoman Waters serves as a member of the Steering & Policy Committee and is the Co-Chair of the bipartisan Congressional Task Force on AlzheimerÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Disease. She is also a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and member and past chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.
Legislative Leadership
Throughout her more than 40 years of public service, Maxine Waters has been on the cutting edge, tackling difficult and often controversial issues. She has combined her strong legislative and public policy acumen and high visibility in Democratic Party activities with an unusual ability to do grassroots organizing.
Prior to her election to the House of Representatives in 1990, Congresswoman Waters had already attracted national attention for her no-nonsense, no-holds-barred style of politics. During 14 years in the California State Assembly, she rose to the powerful position of Democratic Caucus Chair. She was responsible for some of the boldest legislation California has ever seen: the largest divestment of state pension funds from South Africa; landmark affirmative action legislation; the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first statewide Child Abuse Prevention Training Program; the prohibition of police strip searches for nonviolent misdemeanors; and the introduction of the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first plant closure law.
As a national Democratic Party leader, Congresswoman Waters has long been highly visible in Democratic Party politics and has served on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) since 1980. She was a key leader in five presidential campaigns: Sen. Edward
---
Kennedy (1980), Rev. Jesse Jackson (1984 & 1988), and President Bill Clinton (1992 & 1996). In 2001, she was instrumental in the DNCÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs creation of the National Development and Voting Rights Institute and the appointment of Mayor Maynard Jackson as its chair.  
Following the Los Angeles civil unrest in 1992, Congresswoman Waters faced the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs media and public to interpret the hopelessness and despair in cities across America. Over the years, she has brought many government officials and policy makers to her South Central L.A. district to appeal for more resources. They included President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Secretaries of Housing & Urban Development Henry Cisneros and Andrew Cuomo, and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve System. Following the unrest, she founded Community Build, the cityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs grassroots rebuilding project.  
She has used her skill to shape public policy and deliver the goods: $10 billion in Section 108 loan guarantees to cities for economic and infrastructure development, housing and small business expansion; $50 million appropriation for ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂYouth Fair ChanceÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ program which established an intensive job and life skills training program for unskilled, unemployed youth; expanded U.S. debt relief for Africa and other developing nations; creating a ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂCenter for Women Veterans,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ among others.  
Rep. Waters continues to be an active leader in a broad coalition of residential communities, environmental activists and elected officials that aggressively advocate for the mitigation of harmful impacts of the expansion plan for Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Furthermore, she continues initiatives to preserve the unique environmental qualities of the Ballona wetlands and bluffs, treasures of her district.  
She is a co-founder of Black Women

ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Forum, a nonprofit organization of over 1,200 African American women in the Los Angeles area. In the mid-80s, she also founded Project Build, working with young people in Los Angeles housing developments on job training and placement.
As she confronts the issues such as poverty, economic development, equal justice under the law and other issues of concern to people of color, women, children, and poor people, Rep. Waters enjoys a broad cross section of support from diverse communities across the nation.
Throughout her career, Congresswoman Waters has been an advocate for international peace, justice, and human rights. Before her election to Congress, she was a leader in the movement to end Apartheid and establish democracy in South Africa. She opposed the 2004 Haitian coup dÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂetat, which overthrew the democratically-elected government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide in Haiti, and defends the rights of political prisoners in HaitiÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs prisons. She leads congressional efforts to cancel the debts that poor countries in Africa and Latin America owe to wealthy institutions like the World Bank and free poor countries from the burden of international debts.
Congresswoman Waters is the founding member and former Chair of the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂOut of IraqÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Congressional Caucus. Formed in June 2005, the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂOut of IraqÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Congressional Caucus was established to bring to the Congress an on-going debate about the war in Iraq and the AdministrationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs justifications for the decision to go to war, to urge the return of US service members to their families as soon as possible.
Expanding access to health care services is another of Congresswoman WatersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ priorities. She spearheaded the development of the Minority AIDS Initiative in 1998 to address the alarming spread of HIV/AIDS among African Americans, Hispanics an

d other minorities. Under her continuing leadership, funding for the Minority AIDS Initiative has increased from the initial appropriation of $156 million in fiscal year 1999 to approximately $400 million per year today. She is also the author of legislation to expand health services for patients with diabetes, cancer and AlzheimerÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs disease.
Congresswoman Waters has led congressional efforts to mitigate foreclosures and keep American families in their homes during the housing and economic crises, notably through her role as Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity in the previous two Congresses. She authored the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, which provides grants to states, local governments and nonprofits to fight foreclosures, home abandonment and blight and to restore neighborhoods.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Through two infusions of funds, the Congresswoman was able to secure $6 billion for the program.
She is lauded by African American entrepreneurs for her work to expand contracting and procurement opportunities and to strengthen businesses. Long active in the womenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs movement, Rep. Waters has given encouragement and financial support to women seeking public office. Many young people, including those in the hip-hop music community, praise her for her support and understanding of young people and their efforts at self-expression. One testament to her work is the Maxine Waters Employment Preparation Center, a multimillion dollar campus providing education and employment opportunities to residents of the Watts area.

Nanette BarragÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡n was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 2016, becoming the first Latina ever to represent CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 44th Congressional district.
Born and raised in the Harbor Gateway, NanetteÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs humble beginnings shaped her interest in issues that matter locally: environmental and health justice, immigration reform, strengthening the economy and affordable and accessible education.
As the youngest of eleven children raised by immigrant parents from Mexico, Nanette knows about the challenges that many low-income minority families face firsthand.  Her father, a local tv repairman, instilled in her a strong work ethic and influenced her love for baseball (in particular, for the Los Angeles Dodger

With a desire to give back to her communities, in the late 1990s Nanette began her career in public service. She steered outreach efforts for African Americans in the Office of Public Liaison for the Clinton White House and worked for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) focusing on racial health disparities and discrimination.
Nanette was the first woman in 10 years to be elected to the Hermosa Beach City Council, and was then elected by her peers as the first-ever Latina to serve as Mayor of the beach city. During her two-year term on the city council, Nanette was a strong advocate for environmental justice as she successfully stood up to a powerful oil company and stopped a proposal to drill 34 oil and water injection wells in Hermosa Beach and out into the Santa Monica Bay.
Prior to practicing law for ten years, Nanette served as an extern to Justice Carlos Moreno of the Supreme Court of California and, at the Los Angeles Legal Aid Foundation, she fought for justice for low-income families.
In 2016, Nanette decided to take her advocacy to the national level. She ran to represent her neighbors, friends and family members in Congress, with a focus on bringing change and opportunities for those who need it most.
In the 115th Congress, Nanette was elected by her peers to serve as the freshman class president as well as a regional whip, working with her colleagues and reporting back to leadership their thoughts on le

About Lou
Congressman Lou Correa is a longtime Orange County resident, with deep local roots. To this day, he lives only three miles from his childhood neighborhood in Anaheim. He is the son of working-class parents whose hard work gave him a chance at success. Lou has spent his career fighting to protect the American Dream, and ensure anyone can reach the middle class, just as he did.
Growing Up In Anaheim
When Lou was young, his mother cleaned hotel rooms across from Disneyland, and his father held a manufacturing job at a paper mill. Through hard work, LouÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs parents gave him access to better education than they had, and a path to the middle class.
Lou credits his success to his education and the Anaheim public school system where he attended Benjamin Franklin Elementary, Fremont

---
Junior High, and Anaheim High School. Lou graduated from California State University, Fullerton with a degree in Economics. Always striving for more, Lou returned to college and earned his Juris Doctor (JD), and Master in Business Administration (MBA) from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
Early Career
After college, Lou used his education to become a banker, attorney, and licensed real estate broker. His time in the private sector prepared him to compromise and find real solutions to everyday problems.
In 1996, Lou ran for the California State Assembly. Lou lost that election, but he returned in 1998 and won, becoming a voice for the middle class families in Orange County.
Over the next decade, Lou would serve Orange County on the Orange County Board of Supervisors and the California State Senate.
Representing Orange County
In 2016, Lou was elected to the U.S. House Of Representatives to continue his work by representing the community he has spent the past 20 years serving.
In Washington, Congressman Correa continues his fight to give everyone access to the same the opportunity he had. Congressman Correa is committed to working across party lines to strengthen the middle class and give everyone a shot at the American Dream by investing in education, healthcare, and our fading infrastructure.
Congressman Correa has worked to support public health and safety services, mental health care, and health and safety programs for children. He has championed affordable higher education and taxpayer equity while protecting taxpayers by fighting ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwaste, fraud, and abuse.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Since entering office, Congressman Correa has introduced legislation to protect the legal rights of immigrants, care for veterans, and fight against the wasteful spending of taxpayer money.

Representative Dave Min was elected in 2024 to represent CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 47th Congressional District in the heart of Orange County, which includes the cities of Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach, Irvine, Laguna Beach, Newport Beach and Seal Beach, as well as parts of Laguna Hills and Laguna Woods.
Dave is the child of Korean immigrants and a product of California public schools, who lives in Irvine with his wife Jane and their three children. He previously served as a California State Senator from 2020-2024, where he focused on affordable housing, gun violence prevention, climate action and small business development.
As a State Senator, Dave chaired the Natural Resources and Water Committee and authored more than 30 laws, including many first-in-the-nation bills in the areas of domestic violence (including the first law in the world to recognize reproductive coercion as a form of domestic violence), gun violence prevention (including the first law in the country banning the sale of guns and ammunition on all state property), and environmental protection (including the first law in the United Stat

es to codify the 30x30 goals outlined by leading scientists to protect 30% of our open spaces and coastal waters by the year 2030). Dave also was responsible for bringing more than $70 million in direct appropriations to Orange County for local priorities including open space preservation, parks, and wildfire prevention.
Before becoming an elected official, Congressmember Min was a law professor at UC Irvine, where he taught and researched in the area of business law. At that time, he was considered one of the countryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs leading experts on banking and housing policy, and testified six times before Congress on these issues.
Dave is a proud alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned degrees in the College of Arts and Sciences (B.A. Philosophy) and the Wharton School of Business (B.S. Economics), and Harvard Law School, where he earned his
Juris Doctorate
. Dave began his career prosecuting Wall Street fraud at the Securities and Exchange Commission, where he served as an Enforcement Attorney.
DaveÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs basic philosophy of governance is one of long-termism, summed up by this quote from the ancient Greeks:
A civilization is great when its elders plant trees whose shade they will never sit in.

District in the United States House of Representatives.
The 48th District encompasses the central and eastern parts of San Diego County and a portion of Riverside County, including the communities of Fallbrook, Bonsall, Valley Center, Ramona, Escondido, Santee, Poway, Lakeside, Alpine, Temecula, Murrieta and the mountain and desert areas of the San Diego-Imperial County line.
Originally from Ohio, Issa enlisted in the U.S. Army when he was a senior in high school
. Through his military service, he received an ROTC scholarship and graduated with a degree in business from Siena Heights University in Adrian, Michigan. Upon graduation, Issa was commissioned as an Army officer, and ultimately obtained the rank of captain. He completed his active-duty military service in 1980 an

d turned his interests to the private sector.
At the height of his career in business, Issa served as CEO of a California-based electronics company that he founded and built in the mid-1990s, which became the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs largest manufacturer of vehicle anti-theft and auto security devices. In 1994, Issa was named Entrepreneur of the Year. Issa also served as chairman of the Consumer Electronics Association, an organization of 2000 companies within the consumer technology industry.
Issa is a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  From 2011-2015, he was the Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, andÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  previously served on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Energy & Commerce Committee, and the Small Business Committee.
As a congressman and leader at CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs grassroots level, Issa has championed smart, limited government and advanced legislation to balance the federal budget and promote transparency to hold government accountable to the people.
A holder of 37 patents, Issa has been vigilant about protecting intellectual property rights. His successful efforts to fight human trafficking along the U.S. border have resulted in tougher laws, stiffer penalties, and more consistent enforcement. His watchful concern to guarantee that U.S. taxpayers receive the royalties they are owed from mineral interests on federal lands exposed fraud and mismanagement at the Mineral Management Service (MMS) in 2006. In 2008, when Congress was asked to pass the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in the wake of that yearÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs financial crisis, Issa stood by his experience starting and growing successful businesses, opposed giving a blank-check bailout to Wall Street, and voted against all government bailo

49th District
Representative Mike Levin is proud to represent California's 49th Congressional District, which includes North County San Diego and South Orange County.
Currently se
---
rving his third term in the House of Representatives, Mike is a member of the House Committee on Natural Resources and the House Committee on VeteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Affairs, where he serves as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity. Through these roles,
more than two dozen of his bills have been signed into law by presidents of both parties
.
Mike was raised in South Orange County and attended local elementary and junior high schools. He spent his high school years at Loyola High in Los Angeles, and went on to study at Stanford University, where he served as the Student Body President. Upon graduation from Stanford, Mike served as a Coro Fellow and then attended Duke University School of Law.
Prior to being elected to Congress in 2018, Mike fought for climate action while working as an environmental attorney. He also served on the board of the Center for Sustainable Energy and co-founded Sustain OC, helping accelerate the transition toward more sustainable power generation and transportation alternatives.
As a Member of Congress, some of MikeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs top priorities are combating climate change, protecting our natural resources, and capitalizing on the economic benefits of a sustainable energy future. He has led legislation to transition the United States to zero emission vehicles, ban new offshore drilling along the coast of Southern California, responsibly develop renewable energy on public lands, and much more.
Throughout his career, Levin has been a passionate leader on environmental protection, clean energy, and combating climate change.
Another priority for Mike is increasing oversight and accountability at the decommissioning San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) and moving the onsite spent nuclear fuel out of the region as quickly and safely as possible.
---
---
Mike established a local task force upon arriving to Congress to formulate policy recommendations to address the hazardous waste. He is the founding Member and Co-Chair of the Spent Nuclear Fuel Solutions Caucus, a bipartisan group to drive progress on the safe storage, transportation, and disposal of nuclear fuel across the country. He has also led bipartisan legislation to prioritize the removal of spent nuclear fuel from environmentally sensitive sites like San Onofre and mandate resident inspectors at decommissioning nuclear power plants during sensitive activities. Mike has twice hosted Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm at SONGS, where together they highlighted MikeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs work on sustainable spent nuclear fuel management and the federal governmentÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs efforts to remove nuclear waste from the region.
Mike continues to be an outspoken advocate for removing the spent fuel from San Onofre. He is the founding Member and Co-Chair of the Spent Nuclear Fuel Solutions Caucus.
Mike is also a leader on legislation to support veterans and their families. As the grandson of a World War II veteran and the representative of Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, Mike is an advocate for servicemembers and veterans who have sacrificed for our country. He has fought to protect the Department of Veterans Affairs from privatization efforts and has passed laws to improve veteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ health care and services, expand job opportunities for those who have served, and provide stable, affordable housing to homeless veterans.
Mike is proud to be the lead Democrat on the House VeteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Affairs CommitteeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity. During his four years as Chair, the Subcommittee was one of the most productive in Congress, with 70 bills passing into law to serve veterans. Mike s

ponsored one of the most consequential pieces of legislation signed for veterans in recent years, the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020, which strengthened and expanded a wide range of veteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¯Mike continues his steadfast support of our servicemembers, introducing and passing bipartisan legislation to secure greater economic benefits to protect veteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ financial futures and wellbeing.  
Mike has brought tens of millions of dollars in federal funds to improve the regionÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs infrastructure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  
He has also championed efforts to expand access to affordable health care, combat food insecurity, preserve Social Security and Medicare, prevent gun violence, diversify and strengthen our local water supply, and protect a woman's right to choose. Mike is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and, as the grandson of immigrants from Mexico, a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.  
Mike holds monthly town halls to keep his constituents informed and answer their questions, and he has made many of those town halls available as part of his podcast,

Mike lives in San Juan Capistrano with his wife, Chrissy, and their two children.

Prior to serving in Congress, Thompson represented California's 2nd District in the California State Senate, where he chaired the powerful Budget Committee.

onsibility.
In 1990, Thompson was the first Vietnam veteran elected to the California State Senate. He served in combat with the U.S. Army as a staff sergeant/platoon leader with the 173rd Airborne Brigade where he was wounded and received a Purple Heart. He was also an instructor at the Army's Airborne School.
Thompson is recognized in Congress and throughout his district as a strong leader for Democratic principles who has built a solid reputation for bipartisan problem solving.
Thompson's number one priority in Congress is to create jobs and grow our economy. He has co-authored numerous pieces of legislation to improve our nation's infrastructure, boost our renewable energy economy, and better our education system.
As Co-Chair of the bipartisan Military Veterans Caucus, he led the effort to improve treatment options for servicemembers suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress and Traumatic Brain Injury. He has authored bills to help veterans find work as they make the transition back to civilian life. And, as someone who went to college on the GI Bill himself, he helped lead the effort in Congress to pass the 21st Century GI Bill.
With a national debt of more than $30 trillion, Thompson is working on a balanced approach to get our fiscal house in order that includes creating jobs, cutting spending, asking everyone to pay their fair share, and requiring Congress to pay for the bills it passes.
In the wake of the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, Thompson was named Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. Thompson is a hunter, gun owner and strong supporter of the Second Amendment. He also believes that Congress should do more to reduce gun violence. In February of 2013, Thompson's task force released a comprehensive set of policy principles that will r

educe gun violence and respect the Second Amendment, including expanding the criminal background check system to all commercial firearm sales.
Thompson is the husband of a family nurse practitioner. He knows firsthand of the challenges that exist in our health care system. That is why he voted to pass the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and is working to build on the reforms made in the ACA to further improve everyone's access to affordable, quality health care.
As an avid outdoorsman, Thompson is committed to preserving our district's beautiful lands. Thompson was awarded the Sierra Club's Edgar Wayburn Award for passing legislation that permanently protects 273,000 acres of wilderness in Northern California. The award is given in recognition of service to the environment by a person in government. Thompson was joined by other Sierra Club award winners, including former Vice President Al Gore and author and New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman.
Thompson is the co-author of comprehensive immigration reform. He also has worked to ensure equal rights for same sex couples, and has co-authored legislation that gives state and local law enforcement the tools to prosecute hate crimes based on sexual orientation. As a combat veteran, Thompson worked to end the discriminatory policy of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell.""
Thompson is a small vineyard owner and was the maintenance supervisor for the Beringer Winery. He has taught Public Administration and State Government at San Francisco State University and California State University, Chico. He received his Master's of Public Administration from California State University, Chico.
He is married to Janet Thompson. They have two sons, a firefighter and a deputy sheriff, and three wonderful granddaughters.

Often described as ""the gold standard"" for fiscal conservatism in Congress, the National Taxpayers Union rated him the best vote for taxpayers in the House four times, most recently in 2020. Citizens Against Government Waste recently named him as one of the perfect votes in the House fighting wasteful government spending.

McClintock is a member of the House Judiciary Committee where he serves as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement and also serves on the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government. He is a senior member of the House Natural Resources Committee where he serves on the Subcommittee on Federal Lands, which he chaired from 2015 to 2018, and on the Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife, and Fisheries, which he chaired from 2011 to 2015. The Congressman is also a member of the House Budget Committee and has proposed major fiscal reforms to curb unauthorized appropriations, control mandatory spending, balance the budget and protect the nation's credit.

Prior to his election to Congress, McClintock served 22 years in the California legislature, where he became one of its most recognized conservative leaders. He twice received the Republican nomination for State Controller, narrowly missing election in 2002 by 23/100ths of one percent. He ran as the conservative standard bearer for Governor in California's historic recall election in 2003.",1,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0

U.S. Representative
Ami Bera, M.D.
Making Government Work for Sacramento County
Congressman Ami Bera, M.D. has represented Sacramento County in the U.S. House of Representat
---
ives since 2013. The 6th Congressional District is located just east and north of California's capital city, Sacramento, and lies entirely within Sacramento County.
Representative Bera is currently a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where he serves as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific. He is also a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic. Congressman Bera is also a member of New Democrat Coalition, a group of over 100 forward-thinking Democrats who are committed to pro-economic growth, pro-innovation, and fiscally responsible policies.
A lifelong Californian and son of Indian immigrants, Congressman Bera grew up believing America was a land of opportunity, where if you worked hard and played by the rules, you could reach your full potential. He attended California's public schools from grammar school through medical school, earning both his B.S. and M.D. from the University of California, Irvine. With help from his family, scholarships, and working part-time, he put himself through medical school while taking advantage of federally-funded student loans, and graduating with less than $10,000 in debt. He credits much of his success to his country's investment in him, and he's working to ensure that we continue to invest in hard working Americans to keep the American Dream alive for the next generation.
During Congressman Bera's twenty-year medical career, he worked to improve the availability, quality, and affordability of healthcare. After graduating from medical school in 1991, he did his residency in internal medicine at California Pacific Medical Center, eventually becoming chief resident. He went on to practice medicine in the Sacramento area, se

rving in various leadership roles for MedClinic Medical Group. Chief among his contributions was improving the clinical efficiency of the practice. He then served as medical director of care management for Mercy Healthcare, where he developed and implemented a comprehensive care management strategy for the seven-hospital system.
Congressman Bera went on to put his medical experience to work for his community, serving Sacramento County as Chief Medical Officer. In that role, he fought to reduce the cost of health care, create jobs, and deliver care to tens of thousands of Sacramento residents. He then moved into education, working as clinical professor of medicine and associate dean for admissions and outreach at University of California, Davis, where he taught the next generation of doctors. He also helped the University's student-run clinics find innovative ways to engage with the community and deliver care to those who needed it most.
In Congress, Bera uses the skills he learned as a doctor to listen to the people of Sacramento County and put people ahead of politics to move our country forward. His priority is to work alongside people in both parties to address our nation's most pressing challenges and make government work. Bera believes Congress should be a place for service, not for politicians who only look out to protect their own careers, pay, and perks.
Representative Bera has also made it a priority for his office to make government work for Sacramento County. His office has now helped return more than $19 million to local taxpayers ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ everything from backlogged veterans' benefits to Social Security savings. His office also has helped more than 31,000 Sacramento County residents since 2013.

Biography

Congresswoman Doris Matsui has represented the city of Sacramento and its surrounding areas since 2005. As a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, she serves as the Ranking Member of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee and as a member of the Energy, Climate, and Grid Security Subcommittee. She is committed to strengthening SacramentoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs flood protection, ensuring quality, affordable health care for all, growing our clean energy economy, and promoting innovation and equity in technology.
Sitting at the confluence of the Sacramento and American Rivers, the Sacramento area has one of the highest flood risks in the country. Congresswoman Matsui has long led the charge to secure federal funding to address these risksÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂsecuring over $4 billion in investments for local flood prevention. She was at the forefront of the
---
---
effort to build the Joint Federal Project at Folsom Dam, securing $1 billion for this critical project that became the model of cooperation and efficiency. She continues to secure funding to ensure the Folsom Dam Raise Project moves forward as planned. In addition, she has worked vigorously to federally authorize and fund the Natomas Levee Project, West Sacramento Project, widening of the Sacramento Weir, and bolstering of levees in South and East Sacramento. With climate change bringing more frequent, intense, and unpredictable weather patterns, her role in delivering funding for flood control and infrastructure projects is even more critical.
As Ranking Member of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, Congresswoman Matsui is a national leader on technology and innovation policy. She authored the
CHIPS for America Ac
t, legislation that invested $52 billion to reassert American leadership in the strategically important semiconductor industry. She also serves as Co-Chair of the bipartisan High-Tech and Spectrum Caucuses, spearheading efforts to address the pressing tech issues of today and tomorrow while increasing the accessibility and affordability of communications services. She continues to focus on promoting the deployment of next-generation wireless technologies and maintaining a healthy spectrum pipeline. She is a leading voice for policies that support access to reliable, affordable, high-speed broadband for families and students, while ensuring that digital equity, and inclusion are top of mind. She authors the
Digital Equity Foundation Act,
which would channel public and private investments to help close the divide on digital equity, inclusion, and literacy. She leads the Net Neutrality and Broadband Justice Act, which wo
---
uld ensure access to a free and open internet by prohibiting internet fast lanes from harming consumers, small businesses and innovators.
She has worked tirelessly to improve access to high-quality, affordable, and accessible health care and was instrumental in crafting the
Affordable Care Act (ACA)
. She is a leader in Congress on expanding the use of telehealth and growing the digital health ecosystem to help bridge gaps in care. She is an advocate for robust mental and behavioral health services, authoring the
Telemental Health Care Access Act
, which would repeal the requirement that Medicare patients be seen in person before receiving virtual behavioral health care. She was also instrumental in launching a network of high-quality, evidence-based Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) in communities across the country. Her
Excellence in Mental Health Act
was signed into law by President Obama in 2014 and made a $1.1 billion dollar investment in the initial demonstration. The CCBHC demonstration option was expanded to all 50 states as part of the
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act
.
Congresswoman Matsui is a Founder and Chair of the Congressional Task Force on Aging and Families, where she addresses the full spectrum of issues that affect seniors, from retirement security to long term care. Congresswoman Matsui also serves as Co-Chair of the Rare Disease Congressional Caucus, where she works on policies to advance the science of rare disease therapies and expand access to care.
As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy, Climate, and Grid Security and Co-Chair of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC), Congresswoman Matsui is one of the foremost leaders in Congress advancing bold policies to address the climate
---
crisis. Under her leadership, SEEC has spearheaded numerous initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable infrastructure, providing tax incentives for clean energy, and reducing harmful emissions. She co-chairs the Nature and Oceans Task Force, which looks to harness the power of public lands and waters through natural climate solutions. She was a vocal leader in securing robust tax incentives and credits through the
Inflation Reduction Act,
and has worked in tandem with local leaders to ensure the regional community has the resources it needs to lead on the clean energy transition. She has been a long time champion of stronger vehicle emission standards at the national level, and a tireless advocate for CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Clean Air Act waiver. Congresswoman Matsui authored the bipartisan Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2019, reauthorizing a popular program for reducing emissions from diesel vehicles. The Congresswoman also led the Healthier and Greener Schools Act, which funds sustainable retrofits at K-12 schools, and she co-led the POWER ON Act, which created a grant program to harden the electric grid against natural disasters and prevent wildfire ignition from power lines. Thanks in large part to her efforts, the Sacramento region has been transforming into a clean-tech capital, with over 200 companies in the region.
Congresswoman Matsui passionately works to improve and rebuild SacramentoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs infrastructure. She has secured large investments in regional public transportation and the Sacramento International Airport through the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
, and is a strong proponent of robust investments in our transit hubs.
Because she has always felt the arts connect innovation with creativity and passion, Congresswoman Matsui has been a strong supporter of the
---
---
 arts not only in the Sacramento community, but nationwide. She currently serves as a Member of the Board of Regents for the Smithsonian. She is also on the Council of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, and the Council of the National Museum of American History. She has previously served on the National Symphony Board and the Arena Stage Board.
Before coming to Congress, Doris Matsui served as Chairwoman on the Board for the KVIE public television station in Sacramento, and in leadership capacities for the Crocker Art Museum, Sacramento Children's Home, and the Sacramento Symphony Orchestra.
After growing up on a farm in CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Central Valley, Congresswoman Matsui graduated from the University of California at Berkeley.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  She served as one of eight members of President ClintonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs transition board and later served as Deputy Assistant to the President in the White House Office of Public Liaison. Congresswoman Matsui succeeded her late husband Robert Matsui (who served in Congress from 1979-2005) in a special election in March 2005.
Congresswoman Matsui has a son Brian Matsui and a daughter-in-law Amy Matsui. She has two grandchildren, Anna and Robby. In the Spring of 2020, Congresswoman Matsui married Roger Sant, adding four children, their spouses, and six grandchildren to her family.

About John Garamendi
Congressman John Garamendi is honored to represent CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Eighth Congressional District, which includes much of Contra Costa and Solano Counties. He has dedicated his life to serving the people of California and in his eighth term in the House of Representatives, he continues to advocate for working families, veterans, and Americans across the country.
Garamendi was raised in Mokelumne Hill, California and earned his BA from U.C. Berkeley and MBA from Harvard Business School. After graduating, he and his wife Patti served in the Peace Corps in Ethiopia from 1966 to 1968. During their time in Ethiopia, they taught 7
th
and 8
th
graders and worked alongside local leaders to improve the resources available to community members. Their experience in the Peace Corps allowed them to form lifelong bonds and marked only the beginning of their lives dedicated to public service.
In 1974, Garamendi was elected to the California State Legislature, where he authored the first solar, wind, and energy conservation tax credit in the nation. He a
---
---
lso authored the Rural Health Act of California, to ensure that underserved residents in rural communities had access to quality health care.
Garamendi subsequently served four terms in the California State Senate, where he developed a state agenda to advance CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs economy and facilitate scientific research at public universities. Additionally, he introduced legislation that would become CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs assault weapons ban ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the first of its kind in the nation and still in effect today. Today, Garamendi continues his work as an advocate for gun control and remains fervently committed to keeping Americans safe.
From 1991 to 1995, and again from 2003 to 2006, Garamendi served as the California Insurance Commissioner, earning a reputation as the most effective protector of consumer interests in the nation. He successfully forced insurance companies to pay claims to policyholders and significantly curtailed insurance fraud. During his time as Insurance Commissioner, he saw firsthand how far the for-profit insurance industry will go to maximize their profits at the expense of consumers and today, Garamendi remains a consistent advocate for universal healthcare and low prescription drug prices.
Appointed Deputy Secretary of the Interior in 1995 by President Clinton, Garamendi spearheaded projects to restore the environment in the San Francisco Bay, Sacramento Delta, and Sacramento and San Joaquin River basins, while also increasing CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs fresh water supply. Garamendi continues to be a leading advocate for water conservation plans that will protect our natural resources for future generations.
In 2007, Garamendi was elected Lieutenant Governor of California, where he served as Chairman of the State Land Commission and successfully protected California coastal beache
---
---
s by preventing further offshore oil and gas development projects. Additionally, as Chairman of the California Commission for Economic Development, Garamendi strongly advocated for American workers and fought to increase education funding and decrease undergraduate tuition.
Garamendi was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in a special election in 2009, where he has served ever since. Now in his eighth term, he continues to work hard for Californians and advance policies that create jobs, protect Social Security and Medicare, and reduce economic disparity.
As the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness, Garamendi works to ensure current and former service members are treated justly. He has enacted legislation empowering the military to combat climate change, improve health care for servicemembers, and provide greater legal recourse and care for those harmed by unhealthy conditions during military service. Garamendi consistently advocates for veterans and has supported every bill in the House designed to help veterans and their families.

Biography
Image
Rep. Diana DeGette is a fourth-generation Coloradoan who has dedicated her life to serving the people of Colorado's First Congressional District.
DeGette is recognized as a leading voice in the nation's health care debate. As the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, DeGette has played a leading role in overseeing the nation's health care agencies and the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs overall response to the COVID-19 pandemic. SheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs also led numerous efforts to ensure the nation's environmental laws are being properly enforced, lower the cost of insulin for millions of Americans and take on the climate crisis.
DeGette is committed to taking on the climate crisis and empowering our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs clean energy policies. She has led numerous efforts to hold the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs oil and gas producers accountable, reduce AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs overall emissions and expedite our transition to cleaner forms of renewable energy. In fact, one of the first bills President Biden signed 
---
into law after taking office was legislation DeGette authored to drastically reduce methane emissions from drilling sites across ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a move climate scientists praised as critical to combatting the climate crisis.  
A leader on health careÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¦  
Image  
Rep. DeGette believes Congress has a responsibility to make health care more accessible and affordable for all Americans. Among her Congressional colleagues, DeGette is seen as a leading expert on cutting-edge scientific research, including the use of human embryonic stem cells.  
In 2005, DeGette authored the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act to overturn the restrictions President George W. Bush put in place to prohibit the use of embryonic stem cells for research purposes. While Congress voted twice to approve DeGette's legislation, President Bush vetoed it both times. In March 2009, President Obama included the language from DeGette's bill in an executive order he signed to reverse the restrictions.  
In addition to expanding the use of stem cell research, DeGette has been instrumental in expanding the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), which provides health insurance to low-income children. She also played a key role in drafting the Affordable Care Act, which President Obama signed into law in 2010.  
Despite her many accomplishments, the one piece of legislation DeGette is best known for championing is the 21st Century Cures Act, which has modernized the nation's medical research system. The bill, known simply as the Cures Act, has been widely hailed as one of the most important pieces of legislation that Congress has passed in recent years. From cancer research to precision medicine, it has enabled more labs to make more breakthrough discoveries that could soon lead to new cures and treatments for patients around th

Fighting to protect reproductive rights and health careÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¦
Image
As co-chair of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus, DeGette has been leading the fight to restore the protections we had under Roe v. Wade.
DeGette was instrumental in getting the House to pass a historic piece of legislation ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ known as the WomenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Health Protection Act ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ to enshrine into federal law the right of every American to access abortion care in the wake of the Supreme CourtÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. A move that would, in essence, negate the Supreme CourtÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ruling and, once again, ensure all Americans can access the full range of reproductive health care services ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ regardless of where they live.
DeGette is also the co-author of the EACH Act, legislation that seeks to overturn the so-called Hyde Amendment, which continues to prevent millions of low-income women on Medicaid from accessing abortion care. In 2021, she led the fight to successfully exclude the Hyde Amendment from the government's annual spending bill in House for the first time in nearly 50 years.
With a long-standing belief that Roe v. Wade be considered the floor for womenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs reproductive rights, not the ceiling, DeGette has dedicated her time in Congress to not only defending everyoneÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs access to reproductive care, but also expanding it. She has fought tirelessly to expand Americans' access to birth control and other family-planning services. And, in 2020, she helped lead the effort to rescind a Trump Administration rule that allowed employers to refuse to provide birth-control coverage for their employees.
Fighting to protect the environmentÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¦

tte sponsored legislation that was signed into law to make all national parks and public lands free for fourth grade students and their families to visit. She also authored a historic piece of legislation, known as the Colorado Wilderness Act, to protect and preserve 660,000 acres of wilderness across Colorado.
In 2007, DeGette successfully brokered a deal to enact tough new standards to protect Americans from lead in drinking water. She also played a key role in the effort to ban phthalates, a dangerous chemical which is harmful to children.
And, as the top Democrat on the subcommittee that's responsible for overseeing the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs energy policies, sheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs leading an effort to expedite the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs clean-energy transition to lower our emissions and put us on track to meet our climate-related goals.
Fighting to protect civil rightsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¦
DeGette's passion for protecting people's rights is what led her to pursue public office. Prior to being elected to Congress, DeGette was an attorney in the Denver area where she focused on workers' rights. While in office, DeGette has worked tirelessly to protect the rights of women, immigrants and minorities in Colorado and across the country.
In 2019, DeGette convened the first House oversight hearing on the Trump administration's controversial policy of separating families at the border and continues to fight for the better treatment of immigrants and their families.
In recognition of her outstanding commitment to protecting civil rights, the ACLU of Colorado awarded DeGette with its Carle Whitehead Memorial Award, which is given to those who make extraordinary contributions to protecting civil rights and furthering civil liberties in Colorado. DeGette is also the recipient of the NEWSED Community Development Corporation's Civil Rights Awa

Even in times of intense political division, DeGette has shown an ability to reach across the aisle to get results for the people of her district.
In 2017, DeGette was honored by the Javits Foundation for her renowned commitment to cooperation and collaboration across party lines.
In 2018, the U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress awarded DeGette with its Statesmanship award for her efforts to pass legislation in a collaborative and bipartisan manner.

A graduate of Denver's South High School, DeGette earned her B.A, magna cum laude, from Colorado College in 1979; and a J.D. from New York University School of Law in 1982.
Before being elected to Congress, DeGette served two terms in the Colorado Legislature, including one term as Assistant Minority Leader from 1993-1995.
DeGette is married to Lino Lipinsky. They have two daughters, a son-in-law and one new grandbaby.

About  Joe
Congressman Joe Neguse represents ColoradoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 2nd District in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was elected to his first term in November 2018, becoming the first Black Member of Congress in Colorado history. In December 2022, Rep. Neguse was elected by his colleagues to serve as Chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee (DPCC), becoming the first Coloradan to serve in a senior elected leadership role in the House in over 85 years. He serves on the Natural Resources and Judiciary Committees, and was also appointed by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to serve as one of four Democrats on the prestigious Rules Committee. Rep. Neguse serves as Ranking Member on the House Subcommittee on Federal Lands, which he previously Chaired in the 117th Congress.
Rep. Neguse has earned national praise for
---
---
 his ability to effectively craft and enact legislation. In the 117th Congress, during his second-term, he introduced 103 bills ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the second-most of any member in the House ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and 22 of these measures ultimately became law. He received the Bipartisan Policy CenterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Legislative Action Award in 2022 for his ability to work across party lines, and in 2021 was ranked among the top 10 most effective lawmakers in Congress by the Center for Effective Lawmaking, including as the most effective for legislation on public lands. In 2020, he was recognized as the most bipartisan member of ColoradoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs congressional delegation by the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University, and he received the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂSpirit of ServiceÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ award from the Town Hall Project for his successful Service Town Hall initiative.
Before being elected to Congress, Rep. Neguse served in the Governor of Colorado's Cabinet as the Executive Director of Colorado's consumer protection agency. As one of the youngest people to serve as a state-Cabinet secretary, he achieved key victories, including the recovery of millions of dollars for consumers, investigations culminating in significant financial-fraud cases, the championing of legislation to combat financial fraud against seniors, and the launch of the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first online filing system for civil rights discrimination complaints.
Previously Rep. Neguse was elected to represent ColoradoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 2nd District on the University of Colorado Board of Regents, where he served a six-year term fighting to make higher education more affordable and accessible and building consensus on tough issues, including efforts to lower student health insurance costs and increase wages for the UniversityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs lowest paid workers. He received his B.S. in Political Science and Economics from 
---
---
the University of Colorado-Boulder, where he graduated summa cum laude, and received his J.D. from the University of Colorado School of Law.
Over 40 years ago, Rep. NeguseÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs parents immigrated to the United States from Eritrea. As hardworking immigrants and naturalized citizens, they never forgot nor took for granted the freedom and opportunities the United States gave them and their children. Their experience motivated Rep. Neguse to be an active participant in our democracy at an early age, and to give back through public service. Rep. Neguse's public service is rooted in his firm belief that we should be expandingÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂnot restrictingÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂopportunities for all Americans, and he has spent his career doing the same. His priorities in Congress include lowering health care costs and prescription drug prices, raising workersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ wages, ensuring greater accountability in government, protecting our environment and treasured public lands, putting an end to gun violence, and more.
Rep. Neguse and his wife Andrea live in Lafayette, Colorado, where they are raising their two young children, Natalie and Josh.

Jeff Hurd is a proud Colorado native who grew up in Grand Junction. His first job was bagging groceries at a local storeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂa small but formative role that shaped his appreciation for hard work and community. After graduating from the University of Notre Dame, Jeff earned law degrees from the University of Denver and Columbia Law School. He clerked for federal appeals court judge Timothy M. Tymkovich before practicing law at Sullivan & Cromwell in New York City.
But Colorado was always home. Jeff and his wife, Barbora, returned to western Colorado to raise their family more than a decade ago. He built a successful law practice serving rural communities, focusing primarily on rural electric cooperativesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe locally owned organizations that power much of ColoradoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Third District.
Now, as a U.S. Congressman, Jeff is honored to represent ColoradoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Third District, one of the most stunning and diverse regions in the country. From the rugged San Juan Mountains to the farms and ranches in the San Luis Valley, from Mesa CountyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs breathtaking public lands to PuebloÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs historic steel mill, the district embodies the best of the American West. It is home to world-renowned ski resorts, thriving ranching and agricultural communities, and o

ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Improving roads, bridges, airports, and water facilities across southern and western Colorado.
Science, Space & Technology
ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Ensuring that Colorado remains a leader in energy innovation, aerospace, and advanced technology.
He is a steadfast advocate forÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Western valuesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂfighting forÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ ColoradoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs energy independence, water rights, and rural way of life.
JeffÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs wife, Barbora, grew up in communist Czechoslovakia. Now a proud American citizen, she and Jeff are raising their five children in Grand Junction.

Rep. Crow's official portrait for the 119th Congress.
Congressman Jason Crow represents ColoradoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Sixth Congressional District, encompassing Aurora and parts of Arapahoe, Adams, and Douglas Counties.
Former Army Ranger and Bronze Star recipient Jason Crow grew up working class ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ he worked minimum-wage jobs during high school and enlisted in the National Guard and worked construction to help pay his way through college.
After graduating, Jason joined the active duty Army and served in the ArmyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs storied 82nd Airborne Division and in the elite 75th Ranger Regiment, deploying to both Iraq and Afghanistan. Even when he rose to the rank of Captain, Jason always remembered what it was like to march in the boots of an Army private. For Jason, this is the essence of servant leadership ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ always putting the needs of those you lead ahead of your own ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and it continues to drive his approach today.
When Jason returned home, he looked for ways to continue to give back. Jason struggled to get his veterans benefits and knew

 others were having similar challenges transitioning from service to civilian life so he went to work helping veterans across Colorado. As an attorney, Jason was named DenverÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Pro-bono Lawyer of the Year for work helping service members transition from military to civilian life.
Now Jason has taken his servant leadership to Congress where he represents ColoradoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 6th Congressional District and serves on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and House Armed Services Committee, on which he is the Ranking Democrat of the Intelligence and Special Operations Subcommittee.
Whether combatting the climate crisis, creating better, higher-paying jobs for hardworking families, or preventing gun violence, Jason is focused on putting Colorado and our country ahead of politics and partisanship.

U.S. Representative  
Brittany Pettersen  
Serving Colorado's 7th District  
Brittany Pettersen was born in Colorado and grew up in Jefferson County, the community she is now proud to represent in Congress. She served in the Colorado state legislature for a decade before being elected in 2022 to represent ColoradoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Seventh Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives. She is the first woman to represent this district, which encompasses Jefferson, Broomfield, Lake, Park, Teller, Chaffee, Fremont, and Custer counties. Representative Pettersen is a member of the House Financial Services Committee where she serves on the Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance and as the Vice Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on National Security, Illicit Finance, and International Financial Institutions.  
Before coming to Congress, Rep. Pettersen helped pass legislation in Colorado to lower health

care costs, address the opioid epidemic, protect reproductive health care, and increase access to affordable child care. She is now bringing this proven record to Washington and working to expand these policies nationwide. Rep. Pettersen is leading the fight to improve the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs mental health and substance use disorder treatment programs and crack down on drug trafficking, after seeing firsthand the devastating impacts of the opioid epidemic through her own motherÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs decades-long struggle with addiction.
Through her position on the Financial Services Committee, Rep. Pettersen is working to increase consumer protections, improve housing affordability and accessibility, keep America at the cutting-edge of technological advances, and crack down on drug cartels and terrorist organizations utilizing financial institutions.
While facing many challenges as an at-risk youth, access to great public schools and teachers who believed in her helped Rep. Pettersen become the first in her family to graduate both high school and college. She earned a bachelorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree at Metropolitan State University of Denver by waiting tables to put herself through school. Growing up in the 7th District, this community gave Rep. Pettersen the opportunity to build a better life, and she has spent her whole career fighting to give every Coloradan that same chance.
Rep. Pettersen lives in Lakewood with her husband, Ian, their young son, Davis, and their rescue dog, Ollie.

Congressman John B. Larson
proudly represents
Connecticut's First District
. Now in his thirteenth term, John sits on the influential House Ways and Means CommitteeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂincluding the Subcommittee on Trade and the Social Security Subcommittee, where he serves as the Ranking Member. Throughout his time in Congress, John has proven himself a staunch advocate for Connecticut's working families, our manufacturing and small business ecosystem, and commonsense solutions for the problems Americans face everyday.
Born and raised in the federal housing project of Mayberry Village in East Hartford, John is fond of saying he is the product of public housing, public ed

ucation, and public service. His father, Raymond, worked for Pratt & Whitney, while his mother, Pauline, served on the Town Council. John graduated from East Hartford High School in 1967 and from Central Connecticut State University (CCSU) in 1971.
Before entering Congress, John taught history and coached football at George J. Penney High School. He was also an owner of Larson & Lysik insurance agency, where he saw firsthand the challenges many small business owners must overcome. Following in his mother's footsteps, serving on the East Hartford Board of Education and the East Hartford Town Council. In 1982, he was elected to the Connecticut State Senate, beginning a 12-year tenure representing the 3rd Senate District until 1995. Larson served as Senate President Pro Tempore for eight years from 1987 to 1995.
Commonsense Solutions for Connecticut
During his tenure in the Connecticut State Senate, John authored and passed the nation's first
Family Medical Leave Act.
It would later serve as the model for a national law. As one of eight children raised by working parents, John knew how critical it was for working families to get the support they needed. No parent should ever have to choose between their job and their child. That's why John supports expanding his original vision and providing paid family leave.
Image
First elected to Congress in 1998, John swiftly established himself as a leader and consensus builder. As the
Hartford Courant
has said, ""
in a badly polarized Congress, [John] is more than willing to work with Republicans to get something done.
"" John won an important victory on research and development, and righted a grave wrong in our tax code for those who have been wrongfully convicted of crimes.
In 2013, John was named
Co-Chairman of the Congressional Joi

nt Strike Fighter Caucus:
a bipartisan group charged with keeping members informed on issues related to the development, testing, and deployment of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Ever a champion for Connecticut manufacturing, John led the effort to secure Pratt & Whitney as the sole producer of engines for the F35 Joint Strike Fighter as well as the Aerial Tanker, Presidential Helicopter, and second submarine in Groton. His legislation created the Connecticut Center for Advanced Technology, and he has worked tirelessly to bring academia, labor, private industry, and government together to develop next generation manufacturing programs in Connecticut.
John knows manufacturing is the lifeblood of Connecticut's First DistrictÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthanks in large part to the historic Colt Factory. For more than a decade, John fought to preserve the legacy of American innovation and manufacturing that is
Coltsville
, and in
2014
bill to establish Coltsville as a National Park was signed into law.
John formerly served on the Armed Services Committee, Science Committee, and as Ranking Member of the House Administration Committee. As a senior leader in the House Democratic Caucus, John was named chairman of the Task Force on Election ReformÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂcreated to develop reforms to take big money out of politics and address flaws in the electoral system. He continues to champion much-needed reforms to address the impact of
Citizens United
and the gutting of the
Voting Rights Act
.
Taking a Stand
Change doesn't come swiftly to Washington, but John knows some things are too important to delay. As the nation continues to battle an epidemic of gun violence, John has called on Congress to vote on bipartisan reforms most Americans overwhelmingly support. In the light of tragedies like Sandy Hook and the high levels

of gun violence in urban centers like Hartford,
John helped organize the historic sit-in on the floor of the House of Representatives
.

John has been a leader throughout his tenure in Congress, on every issue he tackles. He has championed the effort to end U.S. dependence of foreign oil through advancing domestic fuel cell technology. He knows these initiatives will do more than keep our planet clean, they will spark new growth for our economy and launch thousands of exciting new jobs. That's why John introduced the
Energy Independence Act
, the
Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Authorization Act
, and the
Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Infrastructure for America Act
to fund and promote fuel cell and hydrogen energy technology. He is also a founder and co-chair of the House Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Coalition.
John stands up for those who need a champion. When he heard retirees in his district were living on $11,000 a year or less, he knew he had to act to keep anyone from retiring into poverty again. So he introduced the
Social Security 2100 Act
to enhance benefits and ensure the foundation of our retirement system remains strong for generations. John has also introduced proposals to allow the federal government to directly negotiate lower drug prices for over
40 million Medicare beneficiaries
.
Among his efforts to promote development in Hartford, John
hosted a delegation of community leaders from the impoverished 06120 zip code
in Washington. John helped these residents of Hartford's Promise Zone meet directly with the agencies and offices now aligned to support them. He also introduced the
Promise Zone Job Creation Act
to encourage employers to bring more jobs into places like Hartford's North End.
Over the years, John has opposed the policies of preemption and unilatera

lism. He voted against the war in Iraq and has focused his concerns on the threats of terrorism, protecting the homeland, and supporting first responders. A vigorous supporter of our troops, John visited Iraq three times, and succeeded in passing legislation to reimburse family members who purchased body armor for soldiers who had not been adequately equipped by the military. John also won a key victory for military families with children on the autism spectrum, ensuring their kids receive the care they need.
He is a lifelong resident of East Hartford, where he lives with his wife Leslie. They have three children: Carolyn, Laura, and Raymond.

About Rosa
Rosa DeLauro is the Congresswoman from ConnecticutÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Third Congressional District, which stretches from the Long Island Sound and New Haven, to the Naugatuck Valley and Waterbury. Rosa serves as Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee and sits on the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, and she is the Ranking Member of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, where she oversees our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs investments in education, health, and employment.
At the core of RosaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs work is her fight for AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs working families. Rosa believes that we must raise the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs minimum wage, give all employees access to paid sick days, allow employees to take paid family and medical leave, and ensure equal pay for equal work. Every day, Rosa fights for legislation that would gi
ve all working families an opportunity to succeed.
Rosa believes that our first priority must be to strengthen the economy and create good middle class jobs. She supports tax cuts for working and middle class families, fought to expand the Child Tax Credit to provide tax relief to millions of families, and introduced the Young Child Tax Credit to give families with young children an economic lift.
Rosa has also fought to stop trade agreements that lower wages and ships jobs overseas, while also protecting the rights of employees and unions. She believes that we need to grow our economy by making smart innovative investments in our infrastructure, which is why she introduced legislation to create a National Infrastructure bank.
Rosa is a leader in fighting to improve and expand federal support for child nutrition and for modernizing our food safety system. She believes that the U.S. should have one agency assigned the responsibility for food safety, rather than the 15 different agencies that lay claim to different parts of our food system. Rosa fights against special interests, like tobacco and e-cigarettes, which seek to skirt our public health and safety rules.
As the Ranking Member dealing with appropriations for Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education, Rosa is determined to increase support for education and make college more affordable for more American students and their families. She is also fighting to protect the Affordable Care Act so that all Americans have access to affordable care. Rosa strongly believes in the power of biomedical research and she is working to increase funding so that we can make lifesaving breakthroughs in science and medicine.
Rosa believes that we have a moral obligation to our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs veterans and their families, and her concern f
or these heroes extends to both their physical and mental well-being. Rosa supports a transformation in how the Department of Veterans Affairs is funded, including advanced appropriations for health services, to ensure its fiscal soundness; and she successfully championed legislation to guarantee that troops deploying to combat theaters get the mental health screening they need both before and after deployment, as well as championed legislation that now provides assistance to todayÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Post-9/11 veterans choosing to pursue on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs.  
Rosa belongs to 62 House caucus groups and is the co-chair of the Baby Caucus, the Long Island Sound Caucus, and the Food Safety Caucus.  
Soon after earning degrees from Marymount College and Columbia University, Rosa followed her parentsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ footsteps into public service, serving as the first Executive Director of EMILY's List, a national organization dedicated to increasing the number of women in elected office; Executive Director of Countdown '87, the national campaign that successfully stopped U.S. military aid to the Nicaraguan Contras; and as Chief of Staff to U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd. In 1990, Rosa was elected to the House of Representatives, and she has served as the Congresswoman from ConnecticutÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Third Congressional District ever since.  
Rosa is married to Stanley Greenberg. Their childrenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂAnna, Kathryn, and Jonathan GreenbergÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂall are grown and pursuing careers. Rosa and Stan have six grandchildren, Rigby, Teo, Sadie, Jasper, Paola and Gus.

Jim Himes represents ConnecticutÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 4th District in the United States House of Representatives where he is serving his ninth term. He serves as Ranking Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and on the House Financial Services Committee.
Jim grew up as the child of a single working mom in a small town. As a member ofÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Congress, Jim works hard to provide all American children the same opportunities he had to succeed: access to a first-rate public school, affordable and effective health care, a decent and safe home, and a supportive community.
Born in Lima, Peru in 1966 to American parent

s, he spent the early years of his childhood in Peru and Colombia while his father worked for the Ford Foundation and UNICEF. As an American abroad, Jim grew up fluent in both Spanish and English and was raised with an awareness of the unique position of the United States in the world. At the age of ten, Jim moved with his mother and sisters to the United States.
Jim graduated from Hopewell Valley Central High School and then attended Harvard University. After completing his undergraduate work, Jim earned a Rhodes Scholarship, which enabled him to attend Oxford University in England where he continued his studies of Latin America, including research in El Salvador.
Prior to his service in Congress, Jim ran the New York City branch of The Enterprise Community Partners, a nonprofit dedicated to addressing the unique challenges of urban
poverty. JimÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs team led the way in financing the construction of thousands of affordable housing units in the greater New York metropolitan region, often using new green technologies to achieve energy efficiency and reduce utility costs.
JimÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs experience at Enterprise spurred his involvement in politics. Putting his expertise in affordable housing to work, Jim served as a Commissioner of the Greenwich Housing Authority, ultimately chairing the board and leading it through a much-needed program of reforms. Jim went on to become an elected member of his town's finance board, setting tax and budget policy for Greenwich. Jim has also served as Chair of his local Democratic Town Committee, organizing others in the community to become more active in the political process.
Jim began his professional career at Goldman Sachs & Co. where he worked his way up to Vice President over the course of a 12-year career. There he worked extensively in Latin A

Congresswoman Sarah McBride
Working to deliver for all Delawareans
Congresswoman Sarah McBride proudly represents the greatest state in the nation, and our countryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs First State, Delaware, as its sole member of Congress.
Sarah grew up in Wilmington and has been serving our state for decades as a public servant and advocate. From 2020-2025, Congresswoman McBride served as State Senator for the First State Senate District. She worked for former Governor Jack Markell and the late Attorney General Beau Biden, and served as the national spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign, the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs largest LGBTQ equal rights organization.
As a state senator, McBride passed legislation expanding access to health care, requiring mental health and media literacy education in public schools, promoting green technologies, and protecting workers and families.
In her first term as state senator, McBride passed the landmark Healthy Delaware Families Act, providing paid family and medical leave to workers throughout the First State and marking the largest expansion of Delaware's social safety net in de

cades. In her final term, she passed the largest ongoing investment into DelawareÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Medicaid program since the Affordable Care Act. Passing the legislation with unanimous and bipartisan support, the Protect Medicaid Act of 2024 unlocks over $175 million annually in new discretionary Medicaid funding to protect, enhance, and expand health coverage for the roughly 200,000 Delawareans who receive care through the joint state- and federal-funded health insurance program.
Prior to her service in the State Senate, McBride led the successful effort to pass a landmark non-discrimination law in Delaware. For her work and advocacy, former Gov. Markell awarded McBride the Order of the First State, making her one of the youngest Delawareans granted the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs highest civilian honor.
Sarah married her late husband Andrew Cray in 2014 and is the proud aunt of seven. She is a graduate of Cab Calloway School of the Arts and American University. McBride has taught public policy at the University of Delaware and is the author of the 2018 memoir, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂTomorrow Will Be Different,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ which includes a foreword from President Joe Biden.

Full Biography
Image
Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, serving as congresswoman for the District of Columbia since 1991, is the Chair of the House Subcommittee on Highways and Transit. She serves on two committees: the Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.
Before her congressional service, President Jimmy Carter appointed her to serve as the first woman to chair the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. She came to Congress as a national figure who had been a civil rights and feminist leader, tenured professor of law, and board member at three Fortune 500 companies. Congresswoman Norton has been named one of the 100 most important American women in one survey and one of the most powerful women in W

ashington in another. The Congresswoman's work for full congressional voting representation and for full democracy for the people of the District of Columbia continues her lifelong struggle for universal human and civil rights.  
Congresswoman Norton's accomplishments in breaking barriers for her disempowered district are matched by her success in bringing home unique economic benefits to her constituents. Among them are senatorial courtesy to recommend federal judges, the U.S. Attorney, and other significant federal law enforcement positions for the District; up to $10,000 per year for all D.C. high school graduates to attend any public U.S. college or university and up to $2,500 per year to many private colleges and universities; a unique $5,000 D.C. homebuyer tax credit, which has sharply increased home ownership in the District and was a major factor in stabilizing the city's population; and D.C. business tax incentives, including a significant wage credit for employing D.C. residents, which has maintained businesses and residents in the District.  
Congresswoman Norton also has brought significant economic development to the District of Columbia throughout her service in Congress, creating and preserving jobs in D.C. The most significant are her work in bringing to D.C. the U.S. Department of Homeland Security headquarters compound, now under construction, and is the largest federal construction project in the country; her bill that is developing the 55 acre-Southeast Federal Center, the first private development on federal land; her work that resulted in the relocation of 6,000 jobs to the Washington Navy Yard; and her successful efforts to bring to the District the new headquarters for the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Fir

earms, along with an additional Metro station at New York Avenue, which has resulted in the development of the NOMA neighborhood.
Congresswoman Norton helped end the city's most serious financial crisis in a century, in the 1990's,by achieving a historic package that for the first time restructured the financial relationship between Congress and the District, by transferring $5 billion in unfunded pension liabilities and billions more in state costs to the federal government.
The Congresswoman, who taught law full time before being elected, is a tenured professor of law at Georgetown University, teaching an upper-class seminar there every year. After receiving her bachelor's degree from Antioch College in Ohio, she simultaneously earned her law degree and a master's degree in American Studies from Yale University. Yale Law School has awarded her the Citation of Merit for outstanding alumni, and Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences has awarded her the Wilbur Cross Medal for outstanding alumni, the highest awards conferred by each on alumni. She is the recipient of more than 50 honorary degrees.

The Congresswoman is a third-generation Washingtonian, and is the mother of John Holmes Norton and Katherine Felicia Norton.

Maxwell's History
Family Life, Upbringing, Young[er] Years
Maxwell Alejandro Frost, born on January 17, 1997, comes from a diverse heritage with roots in Puerto Rican, Lebanese, and Haitian ancestry. Adopted at birth by Patrick Frost, a Kansas-born musician-producer, and his wife Maritza Argibay-Frost, a special education teacher who immigrated to the US from Cuba as a child in the 1960s, Maxwell was joined by his sister, MarÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ­a Elizabeth, three years later. FrostÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs love for music surfaced during elementary school, prompting his father to gift him his first drum set. By the time he reached high school, Frost had become a skilled percussionist and band leader of the award-winning sal

sa band Seguro Que SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ­, based at the Osceola County School for the
Arts. The band would have the opportunity of a lifetime when
they performed at the parade for President Barack ObamaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs
second inauguration.
Before Taking Office
Organizer and Activist
Frost was first inspired to join the fight to end gun violence following the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School when 20 students and six faculty members tragically lost their lives. Frost began working for campaigns across FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂincluding during the 2016 presidential race, when he was part of Hillary ClintonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs staff, and in the following election, as a member of the advance team for Bernie Sanders to drive youth voter turnout. At the ACLU, Frost worked tirelessly as an organizer, advocating for the passage of Amendment Four in Florida, a measure that would reinstate voting rights for former felons and championed abortion rights for Floridians. Frost later became the National Organizing Director for March For Our Lives, one of the largest youth-led political movements to fight for comprehensive gun safety laws.

Running For Office
Transition Into His Official Service
In the summer of 2021, Frost reconnected with his birth mother for the first time. He discovered his biological mother was caught in a cycle of crime and violence while pregnant. As a mother of seven, she made the difficult decision to put him up for adoption because she lacked the resources to care for and raise another child.
This was a turning point in FrostÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs decision to run for office. Frost made waves when he was elected as the first Gen Z member of Congress, representing the heart of Central Florida. Frost was ceremonially sworn in by former Congresswoman Val Demings in front of a crowd of over 1,000 people who came from all across

FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 10th congressional district in Central Florida to celebrate alongside Frost as he became their newest member of Congress.
Introducing My First Bill
Our Champion for Gun Violence Prevention
Fueled by his own experience as a survivor of gun violence and a decade of work as an activist and organizer, Frost came to Congress to champion gun safety. Which is why the first bill Frost introduced, alongside Sen. Murphy, was the Office of Gun Violence Prevention Act in March 2023. Deeply motivated by the issues impacting his community, Frost has also introduced the End Junk Fees for Renters Act, which would bring back power to renters and create more transparency and accountability in the renting process and is also helping deliver over $11 Million to community projects across Central Florida.
Became Reality
A White House Victory
In September of 2023, FrostÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs calls for action became a reality when President Biden announced the formation of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention. Frost had the opportunity to introduce the President in the Rose Garden and celebrate with his colleagues from the gun violence prevention movement. As a freshman member of the minority party in this 118th Congress, Frost has had to overcome many setbacks, but he has never let that stop him from being fearless or creative. With 100 lives lost daily to gun violence in the United States, addressing this issue was urgent. Through creative organizing, Frost sought the power of the Biden-Harris Administration to establish the Office of Gun Violence Prevention ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a testament to young activists having the power to change the world.
Looking Towards The Future
Hope and What I'd Like To Achieve
IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂve devoted my life to the pursuit of justice, and no matter the hurdles that may arise, I remain steadfast in my
---
---
 commitment to advocating for all and working tirelessly on behalf of all. ItÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs clear that the extremists are hurting Floridians. WeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂll continue introducing legislation that transforms lives, bringing back federal money to uplift underserved communities in Central Florida and assisting you in cutting through government red tape. WeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂll continue working with you and for you in Congress and back home in the district.
As a former organizer, if there is one thing I know, change is a process, not an event. Each day presents an opportunity to make incremental strides and create legislation that sets the stage for our collective future. Since I was little, IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂve always had big ideas and looked at the whole picture. And when you step back and envision our future, a sense of hope runs through me that we can build an equitable future that leaves nobody behind. Because when we lead with love, there is no limit to what we can achieve.

Biography
Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna is serving her first term as the Representative for FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Thirteenth Congressional District. She was appointed to serve on the Congressional House Democracy Partnership.
Rep. Luna is the first Mexican-American woman elected to the United States Congress to represent Florida. Raised by a single mother in one of Southern CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs low-income neighborhoods, AnnaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs rough upbringing taught her the importance of hard work and independence. She also firsthand experienced the devastating consequences of radical big-government policies in cities like the one she grew up in.
Anna joined the military at a young age to leave behind the life of AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs low-income, inner-city communities. She would go on to graduate from the University of West Florida with a bachelorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree in biology. While serving in the United States Air Force, Anna met her husband, Andy Gamberzky ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a bronze star recipient who earned a Purple Heart when enemy combatants shot at him in Afghanistan.
Anna believes that the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂbusiness as usualÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ mentality in Washington has ruined the lives of everyday Americans, who are failed by decades of leaders who do not truly value them for anything more than their votes. In Congress, Anna will always fight against the elitist political establishment that has, for far too long, left the American people behind.
Congresswoman Luna resides in St. Petersburg, with her husband Andy.

Working to Protect our Environment, Economy and Address the Climate Crisis
Castor has a long established track record of fighting for all that makes Florida special. She started her professional legal career with the Florida Department of Community Affairs working to enforce environmental and growth management laws that protect wetlands, FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs coastline, endangered species and sensitive lands. In private practice, Castor continued her commitment to FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs environment as a land use/environmental attorney representing local governments. As a Hillsborough County Commissioner, Castor served as chair of the Hillsborough County Environmental Protection Commission that is charged with protecting the air, water, wetlands, and land of our large and diverse county, and the delegated elements of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.
Solving the Climate Crisis and Clean Energy
In June 2020, led by Chair Castor, Democratic members of the former House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis
unveiled a comprehensive plan
titled ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
Solving the Climate Crisis: The Congressional Action Plan for a Clean Energy Economy and a Healthy, Resilient, and Just America.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
The report lays out the Climate Crisis Action Plan, full of detailed, ambitious and actionable climate solutions that Congress should enact to benefit American families in communities across the nation.
The Climate Crisis Action Plan calls on Congress to:
Grow Our Economy and Put Americans Back to Work in Clean Energy Jobs
Protect the Health of All Families
Make Sure Our Communities and Farmers Can Withstand the Impacts of Climate Change
Protect AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Land and Waters for the Next Generation
In December of 2022, the former Select Committee released their
fi

nal report
, titled
""Solving the Climate Crisis: Key Accomplishments and Opportunities.""
The report lays out the historic success of the since the release of the Climate Crisis Action Plan. House Democrats have successfully turned more than 300 of the climate solutions in the report into law, while also passing more than half of our 715 climate recommendations.
In addition, Castor has championed energy efficiency, distributed energy and environmental justice to ensure ALL communities, families and individuals enjoy the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards. A benchmarking bill for the disclosure of energy information for commercial buildings in the 114

Congress was signed into law as part of The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015. CastorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Clean Distributed Energy Grid Integration Act was incorporated into the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, signed into law November 15, 2021 by President Biden.
In the 117th Congress, Rep. Castor stood alongside President Biden during the historic passage of the historic
Inflation Reduction Act
(IRA) in law, a groundbreaking investment that will lower costs, create good-paying jobs, and empower us to address the climate emergency. The IRA will extend the critical American Rescue Plan ACA subsidies for another 3 years, through the end of 2025. This will prevent 3 million Americans from losing their health coverage, and prevent more than 10 million Americans from reduced or lost premium tax credits by the end of 2022.

She is also the author of the Florida Coastal Protection Act to make the 235-mile drilling ban off of FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs west coast permanent, which passed through the House of Representatives.  The Gulf of Mexico BP Horizon disaster was a wake-up call for many who urged ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂdrill, baby, drill.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  She was active and outspoken against BP during the Deepwater Horizon oil blowout disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, which impacted FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs beaches, economy and small businesses. That year, she secured $10 million from BP to support Florida college and university marine research, including the University of South Florida and SarasotaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Mote Marine Laboratory. Castor introduced the Gulf of Mexico Economic and Environmental Restoration Act to fund long-term economic recovery, environmental restoration and research with the fines and penalties to be paid by BP for its pollution under the Clean Water Act. Extensive bipartisan efforts continued on this legislation in 2011, and in June 2012, Gulf Coast states and the Gulf of Mexico achieved a major victory when the RESTORE Act was passed by Congress.
Disaster Response and Resiliency
In the wake of disasters that have destroyed communities in Florida and across the United States, Castor has been unwavering in pressing for federal emergency aid resources to quickly reach the hardest hit regions. After Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, Castor launched a Puerto Rico Recovery and Assistance Task Force to fight for the resources the island needs to rebuild for resiliency and stronger infrastructure and economy, as well as maximize local resources to serve Puerto Rican families that have relocated to Florida. So that no U.S. region or territory ever again experiences 100 percent power loss, as a member of the House Ener

Quality, Affordable Health Care
As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee, Castor was instrumental in ensuring that
health care reform
worked for Florida families, businesses, and university medical and nursing colleges. She helped to draft the landmark Affordable Care Act that passed in 2010, and she has worked tirelessly against weakening new patient protections, especially for neighbors with pre-existing conditions, and educating neighbors about health insurance enrollment in the new marketplace exchange.
Castor has authored legislation to improve childrenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs health care of the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs sickest kids through a ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂhealth homeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ model that launched in her hometown of Tampa, Fla., as well as a
bipartisan bill to address the opioid epidemic
. Castor remains focused on
lowering the cost of prescription drugs
; protecting Medicare for seniors; supports
expanding Medicaid
in the State of Florida; and has authored provisions to remedy the doctor shortage and bring new medical residencies to the state and expand scholarships for medical professions at Florida colleges and universities. Castor works hard to bolster and support our health care institutions -- University of South Florida, Haley VA Hospital, H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute, Tampa General Hospital and BayCare.
Castor co-chairs the Academic Medicine Caucus and ChildrenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Health Care Caucus.

In 2020, provisions
Castor championed
for our service members were included in the yearÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs National Defense Authorization Act, including a
3 percent pay raise for our troops
and a continued
commitment to upgrade base housing for military families.
To help ensure the veterans in her district receive the benefits and care they have earned, Castor regularly holds roundtable discussions with veterans and veterans-related nonprofits to address challenges and maximize collaboration.
In 2022, CastorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ cosponsored the
Honoring Our PACT Act
to authorize VA health care to more than 3.5 million veterans exposed to burn pits and establish a presumption of service connection for over 23 respiratory illnesses and cancers.

Prior to her election to the U.S. House of Representatives, Laurel served as
---

During her tenure, she worked to strengthen FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs elections infrastructure and cybersecurity defenses and ensured accurate and secure elections in the state. From 2013-2019, Laurel served as a Circuit Court Judge in FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Thirteenth Judicial Court in Hillsborough County, appointed by then-Governor Rick Scott.

U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan is co-chair of the bipartisan 30-member Florida congressional delegation and Vice Chair of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax policy, international trade, health care, welfare, Social Security and Medicare. Buchanan is the most senior Republican on the committee and currently serves as Chairman of the Health Subcommittee, a key panel that has broad jurisdiction over traditional Medicare, the Medicare prescription drug benefit and Medicare Advantage. The subcommittee also oversees issues relating to m

edical education, private health insurance programs and subsidies delivered through the tax code, consumer-directed health savings tools and issues related to the quality of and access to care.
Buchanan also serves as the Chairman of the House Democracy Partnership (HDP), a historically bipartisan, twenty-member commission of the U.S. House of Representatives that works directly with more than 20 partner countries around the world to support the development of effective, independent, and responsive legislatures.
A self-made businessman, Buchanan understands that AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs economic strength flows from its entrepreneurial spirit and pro-growth, free-market policies. He currently sits on the prestigious Joint Committee on Taxation, a small group of the most senior tax-writers in Congress. Buchanan previously served as chairman of the Tax Policy Subcommittee and played a key role in passage of a sweeping tax cut bill. During the tax reform debate, he focused on lowering tax rates for individuals and small businesses and led the Small Business and Passthroughs Working Group. He has worked to enact tax incentives to help small businesses, end burdensome regulations and limit frivolous lawsuits.
Since coming to Congress in 2007, Buchanan has had 29 of his legislative initiatives signed into law. These accomplishments include reforms to military training procedures, supporting our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs veterans, confronting the drug epidemic, helping Americans save for retirement, strengthening Medicare, improving the U.S. foster care system and measures to stop animal cruelty.
Buchanan has also been ranked one of the most bipartisan and effective members of Congress by two respected non-partisan organizations: the Lugar Center and the Center for Effective Lawmaking. In 2020, the U.S. Chamb

er of Commerce also rated Congressman Vern Buchanan the highest among the 29-member Florida congressional delegation for his  
record  
of bipartisanship and creating jobs.  
With 220,000 Medicare beneficiaries in FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 16th District, Buchanan is committed to preserving MedicareÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs long-term solvency for senior citizens, as well as bringing down the cost of health care for all Americans. Buchanan was awarded the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂChampion for Healthy SeniorsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ award by a leading advocacy group for protecting Medicare and fighting for lower prescription drug costs. He will continue to be a strong advocate for protecting and strengthening Medicare for both todayÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs seniors and future generations.  
A strong fiscal conservative, the CongressmanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs signature bill is the Buchanan Balanced Budget Amendment Act. He also introduced legislation to stop automatic pay raises for Members of Congress until the budget is balanced. Balancing the budget is an urgent priority as the U.S. national debt has reached $31 trillion and continues to grow.  
Buchanan, who represents more than 70,000 veterans in Southwest Florida, has a strong record of fighting for veterans and military families. Last year, his measure to help veterans retain their valuable G.I. Bill credits was signed into law.  Additionally, his legislation to reduce training accidents following the death of a Bradenton soldier became law as a part of a sweeping defense policy bill in 2021. In 2015, BuchananÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Veterans Identification Card Act, which allowed millions of veterans across the country to receive a free official identification card from the Dept. of Veterans Affairs was signed into law.  
Buchanan grew up with five siblings in a blue-collar household in a small town near Detroit, Michigan. He served six years in the Air National Guard and work

ed his way through college. The self-made businessman is a respected leader in Florida's business community. Buchanan previously served as chairman of the Florida chapter of the Young PresidentsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Organization, the Florida Chamber of Commerce and the Sarasota Chamber of Commerce. He was also a member of the Board of the U.S. Chamber and in 2005 he was inducted into the Tampa Bay Business Hall of Fame.
In addition, Congressman Buchanan is a dedicated philanthropist. He has committed himself to diverse community causes, including the Boys and Girls Club, the Community Foundation of Sarasota County, the Walk to Cure Juvenile Diabetes, the American Heart Walk, the Mote Marine Laboratory and the Ringling Museum of Art.
A husband and father, Congressman Buchanan lives in Longboat Key, Florida with Sandy, his wife of more than 40 years. Vern and Sandy have two grown sons, James and Matt and nine grandchildren.

Biography
Congressman Brian Mast is in his fourth term representing the 21stÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Congressional District of Florida.
Prior to his election to Congress, Brian followed in his fatherÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs footsteps by serving in the U.S. Army for more than 12 years, earning medals including The Bronze Star Medal, The Army Commendation Medal for Valor, The Purple Heart Medal, and The Defense Meritorious Service Medal. While deployed in Afghanistan, he worked as a bomb disposal expert under the elite Joint Special Operations Command. The last improvised explosive device that he found resulted in catastrophic injuries, which included the loss of both of his legs.
While lying in bed recovering at Walter Reed Medical Center, BrianÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs father gave him advice that has stuck with him to this day--to ensure the greatest service he gave to our country and the best example he set for his children was still ahead of him. Brian took this advice to heart and dedicated himself to finding new ways to serve our country and his community.
Brian remained on active duty following the injuries and provided expertise to the National Nuclear Security Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms during his recovery process. After his retirement from the Army, he continued working in counter-terrorism and national defense as an Explosive Specialist with the Department of Homeland Security. Brian subsequently received a degree from Harvard University and volunteered to serve alongside the Israel Defense Forces to show support for the freedom Israel represents throughout the Middle East and the world.
In Congress, Brian strives to serve as he did on the battlefield: without regard for person

Biography
Moskowitz answered the call of public service and was elected to the Parkland City Commission when he was in law school. Right away, he began working for the people he was elected to serve by putting forward and delivering on pragmatic solutions regarding public safety and environmental protection.

When 17 people died in the mass shooting at his alma mater, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, he championed the movement to pass meaningful reforms.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  As a State Representative, he worked with the families of the victims and lawmakersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ onÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ both sides of the aisle to enact historic gun violence prevention legislation, raising the age to buy guns from 18 to 21 and putting in place ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂred flag lawsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ giving law enforcement the power to take away firearms from those too dangerous to responsibly possess them. He also championed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, the most comprehensive gun violence prevention, school safety, and mental health bill ever passed in Florida.
In 2019, Moskowitz was appointed by Governor Ron DeSantis to be FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Director of Emergency Management.

Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson proudly represents FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 24th Congressional District. It is one of the
---
most ethnically and culturally diverse districts in the nation and includes parts of northwest Miami-Dade and southern Broward counties.
Recognizing her record of service and productivity, in 2010 voters overwhelmingly elected her to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. As a former educator, elementary school principal, community leader, school board member, state legislator, and founder of the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project, Congresswoman Wilson earned a reputation as a ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂVoice for the Voiceless.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Her tenure in Congress, now in its fourth term, also has been marked by her signature spirit of unrelenting advocacy on behalf of the less fortunate.
The Florida lawmaker has continued her mission to improve the quality of life for her constituency by creating jobs with dignity, improving education, stopping home foreclosures, safeguarding Medicare and Social Security, and strengtheningÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ ties with Haiti and the Caribbean.
As the Ranking Democrat on the Education and Workforce Protections Subcommittee in the 114th Congress, Congresswoman Wilson introduced the American Jobs Act of 2013, an innovative bill that promotes full employment and boosts workforce development opportunities; the Student Loan Borrower Bill of Rights, which would provide vital relief to overburdened student loan borrowers; and the Youth Corp Act of 2013, which reconnects youth with education, the workforce and their communities. She has also sponsored legislation to reduce homeownersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ insurance premiums, protect foster children, and defend Haitian women against gender-based violence. In addition, the lawmaker, whose mantra is ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂJobs, Jobs, Jobs,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ hosted one of the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs largest job fairs, which connected thousands of Floridians to more than 100 local and national employers.

son is the founder of the Florida Ports Caucus, a bipartisan coalition formed to help pass the Water Resources Reform and Development Act. After being stalled for 12 years, the GOP-led Congress in a bipartisan vote passed the bill in 2014. As a result, her district was awarded billions of dollars in capital funding for major projects like the PortMiami Tunnel, which created thousands of jobs. It also highlighted the lawmakerÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ability to successfully work across party lines.
Congresswoman Wilson has consistently secured resources for various projects in her district, including a $1 million grant in 2014 to help reduce crime in Miami-Dade CountyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs highest crime area, the Northside District. The Department of Justice grant will bolster the Miami-Dade Police DepartmentÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ability to combat crime and violence and make the area a safer place to live, work, and raise families. During her tenure, the district has received $3.1 billion in grants, contracts, and other assistance.In May 2015, Congresswoman Wilson was appointed to the advisory council of President Barack ObamaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂMy BrotherÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs KeeperÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Alliance, a public acknowledgement of the life-changing results for boys and young men of color that she has achieved through the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project. President Obama often cites this program, which she created nearly a quarter century ago, as an example of the kinds of projects that his ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂMy BrotherÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs KeeperÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ initiative is designed to emulate and support. Congresswoman Wilson also is founder and chair of the Congressional Black CaucusÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂMy BrotherÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs KeeperÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Task Force.
Congresswoman Wilson understands CongressÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ role as a global leader in human and civil rights and has led its efforts to fight for the safe return of the 219 Nigerian schoolgirls still missing since th

eir June 2014 abduction by Boko Haram and to aid in the defeat of the terrorist group. In addition to participating in two fact-finding missions to Nigeria and passing two resolutions, she has been a leading voice in a daily, international Twitter campaign to #BringBackOurGirls. The Florida lawmaker also created ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂWear Something Red Wednesdays,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a weekly photo opportunity and press event with congressional leaders and lawmakers. The initiative helps to ensure the girls are not forgotten by maintaining media attention and pressure on U.S. and Nigerian officials to honor their pledge to do all they can to rescue them. A leading political newspaper has dubbed her relentless attention to this human rights crisis ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂFrederica WilsonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs War.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
The Florida lawmaker has worked tirelessly to recognize Americans who have made significant contributions to our nation. She ushered through legislation in record time to memorialize a new Federal Bureau of Investigation building in honor of Special Agents Benjamin P. Grogan and Jerry L. Dove, who were killed in what is considered the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂbloodiest shootoutÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ in FBI history. Most recently, she passed legislation to rename a Miami post office in honor of Father Richard Marquess-Barry, a pillar of the community and one of South FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs most influential and unifying faith-based leaders.
After earning a Bachelor of Science degree in elementary education from Fisk University and a Master of Science degree in elementary education from the University of Miami, Congresswoman Wilson worked as a teacher and assistant educational coordinator for the Miami-Dade County Public Schools Head Start program. She quickly rose to become principal of Skyway Elementary School, which was recognized as one of the best schools in America in President George H. W. Bush

ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂAmerica 2000ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ plan to upgrade national education standards.  
In addition to raising academic standards and expectations, Congresswoman Wilson taught her students the power of advocacy. Their target was a compost plant built across the street from Skyway that emitted odors that posed a major health and environmental hazard and distracted the children from their studies. She and her students mobilized their community and lobbied government and school board officials until they achieved their goal. The compost plant closed its doors just short of two years after its opening.  
The experience highlighted the need for stronger local leadership and led Congresswoman Wilson to successfully campaign for a seat on the Miami-Dade County School Board in 1992. Her first legislative achievement was the establishment of the 500 Role Models of Excellence Project as a district-sanctioned program. The innovative mentoring program was inspired by the extraordinary impact of positive male influence on the attitudes and performance of the boys at Skyway Elementary during her tenure as principal. Now known as the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project, the program has flourished and earned much-deserved national acclaim.  
The 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project has awarded millions of dollars in college scholarships to help hundreds of young men achieve their dream of earning a college degree or post-secondary certification.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  In 1997, President Bill Clinton honored the program, which today serves more than 8,000 students each year, with the Teaching Example for the Nation Award at the Summit for AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Future.  
She won seats in the Florida House of Representatives in 1998 and the state Senate in 2002, whereÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ her peers elected her Senate Minority Leader Pro Tempore and Minority Whip. The

As a state legislator, she worked with Governor Jeb Bush to remove the Confederate flag from the State Capitol and passed a bill mandating HIV/AIDS testing for prisoners upon their release and linking them to care in the counties where they relocated. She also passed a bill that made rape in prison a felony crime. Other legislative achievements and priorities included relocating women in Florida prisons to facilities that would enable them to be closer to their children while serving out their sentences; opposing high-stakes testing; pushing for a ban of the term ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂillegal alienÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ in state public records; and partnering with Governor Charlie Crist to restore voting rights for ex-felons.
Born in Miami, Congresswoman Wilson learned the value of public service and community activism from her parents.  The late Beulah Finley Smith and the late Thirlee Smith, Sr., were small business owners and civil rights activists.  Her brother, the late Thirlee Smith, Jr., was the first full-time African American reporter at the
Miami Herald
and a long-time educator for Miami-Dade County Public Schools, who was responsible for implementing African-American history into the districtÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs curriculum.
Congresswoman Wilson is widowed and the proud mother of three children: Nicole, LaKesha, and Paul ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and has five beautiful grandchildren.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz has dedicated her public life to serving South Floridians and standing up for justice, equality, and opportunity wherever and whenever it is threatened. As FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first Jewish Congresswoman, she has earned the respect of her colleagues for working tirelessly on behalf of seniors, children, and families for nearly three decades.
First sworn in to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2005, Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz previously served in the Florida House of Representatives and Florida Senate where she originally displayed her philosophy that there is ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂno task too small, and no goal too big.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

Known for vigorously defending her progressive values, the Congresswoman has also demonstrated her ability to pass meaningful legislation in a bipartisan fashion. She teamed up with former Republican Senator Arlen Specter to write a resolution ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ passed unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed by President Bush ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ to declare May as

PALS Act
, which helps increase young womenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs access to mammograms.

Carlos Antonio Gimenez proudly represents the people of
FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 28thÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ congressional district, encompassing all of Monroe County and the southwest portion of Miami-Dade County.
Congressman Carlos GimÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ©nez was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2020, becoming the only current Cuban-born member of Congress and the first career firefighter-paramedic to serve in Congress.
He currently serves on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Homeland Security Committee, where he chairs the Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime Security. Appointed by the Speaker of the House, he is also a member of the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communis

t Party and sits on the Board of Regents for the Smithsonian Institution.
Within Republican leadership, Rep. GimÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ©nez serves as Vice Chairman of the Republican Governance Group (RG2) and Vice Chair of Community Outreach for the Congressional Hispanic Conference.
Carlos is a husband, father, grandfather, and a public servant who has dedicated his life to serving the Miami-Dade community.
Born in 1954, Carlos arrived to the United States shortly after the Communist takeover of his native homeland of Cuba, settling in the Little Havana neighborhood in Miami. His familyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs experience helped shape his servantÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs heart and his dedication to this community, understanding the importance of protecting individualsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ freedom to pursue their potential.
Carlos began his journey of public service in 1975 when he joined the City of Miami Fire Department. There, he embarked on a 25-year career as a firefighter in his community, with the last nine years of his tenure as Chief of the department - the very first Cuban American to serve as the Chief of the City of Miami Fire Department.
Congressman Gimenez is married to his wife Lourdes. They have three adult children ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Carlos, Julio, and Lourdes ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and six grandchildren.
In 2000, Carlos was appointed Manager of the City of Miami, overseeing a $500 million annual budget and nearly 4,000 city government employees, with the goal of implementing critical fiscal and administrative reforms for the sustainability of City of Miami operations.
In this capacity, Carlos reduced the cityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs tax rate to the lowest level in 50 years while generating more revenue for the city. Four years later, Carlos was elected as Miami-Dade County Commissioner where he served the countyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 7th district until 2011. In the summer of 2011, Carlos was elected as Mayor of Miami-

Dade County, the highest-ranking official of FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs largest county. He maintained his commitment to bringing fiscal responsibility needed at the county level, working to expand transparency, renegotiate contracts with public sector labor unions and reduce the county government workforce, and implementing the largest tax cut in the countyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs history saving Miami-Dade County taxpayers $2 billion. He was subsequently re-elected as Mayor in 2012 and again in 2016.
Carlos is a proud graduate from Christopher Columbus High School in Westchester, FL and earned a bachelorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree in Public Administration from Barry University in Miami, FL. He completed the Program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government at Harvard UniversityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs John F. Kennedy School of Government.

After graduating from college at Metro State University in Denver, Kat ran Ted YohoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs successful congressional campaign

While in that role, she advocated for small business owners, veterans and military families, agricultural producers, and hardworking families like her own, motivated by her familyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs story.
She holds a MasterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Degree in National Defense & Strategic Studies from the United States Naval War College.
Kat is now in her third term and serves on the House Agriculture and House Energy and Commerce Committees.

She also works to highlight the historic border crisis, visiting the southern border multiple times and sounding the alarm about the dangerous policies of the Biden-Harris administration. She also works to push back on the Chinese Communist PartyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs threats to our national security through Big Tech information gathering and Chinese nationalsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ purchases of American farmland. She consistently works to prioritize constituent advocacy and service, fighting for Florida families.
Kat is the proud wife to her husband Matt, a Gainesville native, who serves with the Gainesville Fire Rescue as a firefighter/paramedic. Kat and Matt have several backyard chickens and ducks and in their rare bit of spare time enjoy spending time with their critters, fishing, football, traveling, and skeet & trap.

Representative Cory Mills honorably serves as a member of the 119th Congress, representing the voices and values of FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Seventh residents. As one of nearly 100 distinguished Veterans currently serving on Capitol Hill, Representative Mills serves on the House Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees. Born in Winter Haven, Florida, Representative Mills spent his formative years in Auburndale, Florida. Raised by his grandparents, he learned the value of stability, resilience, and the importance of community support from an early age. He attributes his journey to his grandparentsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ unwavering love and guidance, who provided him with a nurturing environment. He decided to pursue a path of service and selflessness. At a young age, driven by a sense of duty and gratitude, Representative Mills chose to commit himself to military service.
He served with the 82nd Airborne Division and Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). While serving abroad, he was struck twice in 2006, once with an improvised explosive device (IED) and once with an Iranian explosively formed projectile (
EFP
), which resulted in numerous casualties.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Fortunately, he was able to stabil
---
ize himself and other members on his team who were injured in the explosion prior to evacuation.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  For his actions, former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilizad presented Representative Mills with a Certificate of Appreciation from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad for his actions which saved members of his team and U.S. military service members. His deployments included time in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, Pakistan, and Somalia. Representative Mills has traveled to the front lines of Ukraine during the Russian invasion to provide information for USAID and Department of State officials.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  He also supported anti-terrorism assistance training for the Kurdish forces in northern Iraq to help them repel potential insurgencies. Later on, he was appointed under the Trump Administration to the Pentagon as a Department of Defense (DoD) advisor and a foreign policy expert.  
As an Army Combat Veteran and Bronze Star recipient, he understands firsthand the sacrifices made to uphold the principles of freedom and democracy. His experiences overseas have shaped his perspective on the importance of preserving constitutional liberties and defending against all threats, foreign and domestic, which is why, before taking office in 2021 during the botched withdrawal in Afghanistan, he collaborated with an exceptional team to facilitate the evacuation of an American family stranded in Afghanistan. He replicated this effort as a Member of Congress when American citizens were stranded during the violent conflict in Israel on October 7, 2023. Within a few days, he was in Israel, alongside many of his original team members from the Afghanistan evacuation, all volunteering their services willingly because those are the values embedded in members of the armed forces. With the support of Mercury One and t
---
he Tzedek Association, they ultimately secured a flight to evacuate even more individuals. Eventually, they successfully assisted over 255 Americans in returning safely home to the U.S.
In the private sector, Representative Mills co-founded Pacem Solution International LLC and Pacem Defense LLC.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Through the PACEM companies, they supported risk management assessments, intelligence collection, and security for media such as NPR news.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  In 2018, Pacem Defense acquired Amtec Less Lethal Systems, Inc., now known as ALS, Inc., in Perry, Florida, to help continue its support to the law enforcement communities and our allies abroad.
Transitioning from the battlefield to the halls of Congress, Representative Mills continues his legacy of service by advocating for the values and principles that define the American spirit, with a commitment to upholding the rights and freedoms of the American people, ensuring that the voices of his constituents are heard and respected. In Congress, he seeks to honor the legacy of those who have served before him by championing policies that promote prosperity and security. He remains steadfast in his mission to serve his constituents with integrity, compassion, and a commitment to the values that make America strong.

About

Darren Michael Soto is a democratic legislator, commercial and civil rights attorney, conservationist, and musician from Kissimmee, Florida, who is the representative in Congress for Florida's Ninth Congressional District.
Early Life and Education
Congressman Darren Soto was born in Ringwood, New Jersey, to a Puerto Rican father, O. Lou Soto, and an Italian-American mother, Jean Soto. He attended Lakeland Regional High School, got his Bachelor of Arts in economics from Rutgers University in 2000, and his Juris Doctor from George Washington University in 2004.
While still in law school, Soto moved to Florida with his family in 2002, began working as a summer associate, and became a proud Florida Rican. He was admitted to the Florida Bar Association in 2005 and began practicing commercial, real estate, family, and civil rights law. Soon after, he was named class counsel in federal court for a voting rights lawsuit on behalf of local Hispanics against the City of Kissimmee to create single-member commission districts. Soto was a vice chair of the Orange County Young Democrats for several years

, volunteering, fundraising, and managing several successful and close campaigns.  
Florida House of Representatives (2007ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ2012)  
Soto was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2007 in a special election. He hit the ground running due to his broad legal training and extensive community involvement. During his three terms in the Florida House, Soto supported laws to curb illegal street racing, passed the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂJohn C. CurryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Firefighter Death Benefit Act to protect families of fallen firefighters who died in training exercises, and the Bus Driver Notification Act to help improve school bus safety.  
Soto was an early proponent of developing Medical City at Lake Nona to increase high-paying jobs, research, and healthcare access for the region. He voted for the creation of and funding for the University of Central FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Medical School and wrote a letter of support for the construction of the Nemours ChildrenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Hospital. He also supported funding for the Sanford Burnham Institute, which eventually became the UCF Lake Nona Cancer Center.  
Soto passed the first resolution by a state legislator honoring the Borinqueneers, a historic, segregated U.S. Army unit of Puerto Ricans who served valiantly in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. He was joined by dozens of Borinqueneers and then-Puerto Rican Lieutenant Governor Kenneth McClintock for the passage of this historic resolution in the Florida Legislature. Eventually, multiple state legislatures passed similar resolutions. This helped lead to a groundswell of national support for the Borinqueneers to receive the Congressional Gold Medal.  
Soto was also an early advocate for SunRail to provide new options for commuters to improve traffic in Central Florida. His strong support helped South Orange County and Osceol

a County secure five SunRail stations: Sand Lake, Meadow Woods, Buena Ventura Lakes/Tupperware, Kissimmee, and Poinciana.
Florida Senate (2013ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ2016)
In 2012, Florida Senate districts were redrawn, and Soto opted not to run for reelection in the House. Instead, he decided to run for the newly created 14th district, which included predominantly Latino areas of Orange, Osceola, and Polk Counties.
In 2013, Soto passed the Dream Act DriverÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs License Bill to expedite driver's license access for DACA recipients, but it was ultimately vetoed by Governor Rick Scott, setting off statewide protests. Soto also unsuccessfully proposed an amendment in criminal death penalty cases to require 10 jurors to vote to convict rather than a simple majority of seven.
In 2014, Soto secured $1 million in design funding for the proposed Valencia College campus in Poinciana. He also led the Democratic House and Senate Caucuses in drafting a congressional map during the 2014 Special Session on Redistricting. His was the only map presented by Democrats during that sessionÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂa map compliant with the Fair Districts Amendments. Soto also passed the Florida Bar Dream Act Amendment into law, allowing DACA recipients to become attorneys in Florida. He was also integral in passing legislation to grant DREAMersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ in-state tuition.
During the 2015 legislative session, Soto helped secure $11.9 million in construction funding for Valencia College's campus in Poinciana. He also successfully pushed for $20 million to restore the Kissimmee River, earning him the Audubon Society of Florida's ""Champion of the Everglades"" award. Soto also proposed legislation to ban fracking in Florida. Additionally, he secured $10 million in Florida's budget for a new facility at NeoCity to manufacture microchips and sensors, but Gov
---

ernor Scott vetoed the project. Soto also authored and introduced first-time bills to boost minimum teacher pay to $50,000/year and keep Florida on Daylight Saving Time year-round. These popular bills shaped debate in the Florida Legislature for years to come.
Soto helped create the Osceola Expressway Authority, which raised the $42 million bonds necessary to build Poinciana Parkway and expand Osceola Parkway, among other highway initiatives. The Osceola Expressway Authority was eventually merged into the regional Central Florida Expressway Authority.
In 2016, Soto steered funding to his district, including $15 million for microchip manufacturing at NeoCity, $12 million to complete the construction of the Valencia College campus in Poinciana, $4 million in supplemental school construction money, $750,000 for the Northern Everglades/Lake Tohopekaliga skimmer for pollution prevention, and $150,000 for Transition House, which offers temporary housing for veterans. Soto also passed Chloe's Law to construct barriers around water bodies adjacent to state roads to prevent vehicular drownings, the Deaf Floridian's ID Bill, and the Juvenile Clean Slate Bill to automatically seal misdemeanor records for juveniles who reach 21 years of age and do not re-offend as adults.
U.S. House of Representatives
115th Congress (2017ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ2018) ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ SotoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs First Congress
Soto is the first congressman of Puerto Rican descent elected to represent Florida. In his first few weeks, Speaker Nancy Pelosi named him one of three freshman members of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee. He was also tied for first place for most laws passed by a freshman member during the 115th Congress. Additionally, he was selected to serve on the House Committee on Natural Resources and the House Committee on Agricult

ure, helping pass the 2018 Farm Bill to assist local farmers and ranchers, as well as help feed Central FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs working families.  
Soto and Florida Senator Bill Nelson passed their Hurricane Hunters bill, H.R. 1008, by amendment to the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017. This legislation added two backup Hurricane Hunter aircraft to the NOAA fleet to increase hurricane monitoring and preparedness.  
After Hurricane Irma, Soto led the Florida Delegation in a letter requesting disaster relief for Florida. This effort helped secure over $5.5 billion in federal funding statewide during the term to help Central Florida and other affected areas recover after the storm. It also provided funds for flood control in Osceola County.  
Soto traveled to Puerto Rico in the wake of the deadly Hurricane Maria to meet with residents, document the vast damage suffered by residents, and prepare a Congressional report. This report was integral in making the case for over $50 billion in disaster relief funding for the Island. He also led a Puerto Rico Evacuee Task Force to assist tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who moved to Central Florida after the hurricane with access to jobs, housing, healthcare, and more.  
At the end of 2017, Soto passed his second bill, the Foreign Spill Protection Act, with co-introducer Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo. The bill eliminated a $1 billion cap on damages for foreign oil drillers, whose oil spills pollute AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs waters, to better protect FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs coasts.  
Soto also introduced a bill, H.R. 4042, to rename a Kissimmee Post Office at 1415 West Oak Street after the Borinqueneers. This bill was signed into law on March 23, 2018.  
In 2018, Soto also passed a law to protect billfish, such as marlin, spearfish, and sailfish. The bill, H.R. 4528,
---
closed a loophole in the Billfish Conservation Act, making it illegal to sell billfish in the continental United States. The law passed the House of Representatives on June 25, 2018, and was signed into law on August 2, 2018.
Soto also oversaw the restoration of East Lake Tohopekaliga in St. Cloud to improve clean water, flood control, recreation, and the areaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs habitat. He is proud to represent a large part of the Northern Everglades, which consists of the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes and the Kissimmee River.
In 2017, Soto traveled to Iraq to visit local Florida National Guard service members called to active duty during the Iraq War. In 2018, Soto also visited National Guard troops stationed in Afghanistan from Florida and Puerto Rico. He believed it was critical to see these battlefields firsthand while our nation was at war.
116th Congress (2019ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ2020) ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Soto Enters the Majority
Following his reelection, Soto secured a spot on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, where heÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs been a champion for boosting jobs, advancing technology, protecting consumers, expanding access to healthcare, preserving our environment, and more. He also joined the House Natural Resources Committee to restore the Northern Everglades/Kissimmee Chain of Lakes region, protect local species, habitats, and recreation, defend the sovereignty of local Florida tribes, and help his familyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs native island of Puerto Rico.
Soto passed his first law of the 116th Congress, the Strengthening Mosquito Abatement for Safety and Health (SMASH) Act, which aims to combat future Zika outbreaks in Florida, Puerto Rico, and other areas.
Soto also passed the Venezuela TPS Act of 2019 out of the HouseÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂin a dramatic fashionÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂas the last bill to pass before the August District Work Period.
Soto voted for the fir
---
---
st Articles of Impeachment against President Donald J. Trump. This vote was in response to President TrumpÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs well-documented extortion scheme against Ukraine. Trump threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine to force them to launch false investigations against his then-opponent, then-Vice President Joe Biden.
Soto also worked with Florida U.S. Reps. Val Demings and Stephanie Murphy to renew federal grants to the Central Florida region, including over $30 million for affordable housing homelessness prevention, $3.25 million to fund local anti-terrorism efforts, and nearly $2 million for zero-emission Lynx Lymmo buses.
Soto also assisted in securing federal grants of nearly $30 million for Hurricane Irma disaster relief for Polk and Osceola Counties, over $3 million for healthcare clinics in Osceola and Polk Counties, and $250,000 to improve the airports in Kissimmee and Winter Haven.
In anticipation of a new infrastructure law, Soto led a bipartisan letter with Florida Rep. Michael Walz to begin advocating for funding for the Beyond I-4 Ultimate project to continue the expansion through South Orange, Osceola, and Polk Counties to State Road 27. Every member of the I-4 Corridor Delegation from Volusia to Pinellas Counties signed onto the letter, showing unanimous, bipartisan support for the project. He also hosted House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio in Central Florida for a roundtable with local officials, contractors, and unions to discuss the potential project.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Soto voted for all four pandemic relief packages, including the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Act of 2020, Families First Coronavirus Response Act, Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) and CARES I
---
---
I Act. These acts provided stimulus checks, funded COVID-19 vaccine development, authorized telehealth, created the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses, and enhanced unemployment benefits, state and local relief funds, and other programs to help the nation combat the crisis. Thanks to his position on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Soto also helped lead FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Delegation in securing additional supplies of remdesivir for local hospitals. On May 15, 2020, Soto voted for the HEROES Act, which passed the House and provided further pandemic relief. This legislation included his Save Our Homes Act, which was aimed at helping homeowners save their homes from foreclosure by ending forbearance agreement balloon payments. Unfortunately, this bill ultimately did not make it into the CARES II Act.
On June 26, 2020, Soto passed legislation out of the House designating the Pulse National Memorial in recognition and memory of the 49 killed and 53 injured at the Pulse Nightclub shooting. He introduced this bill with Reps. Demings and Murphy. Upon its passage, Soto said, ""Today, we remind the world that hate will never defeat love, grief can turn into strength, and that a place of loss can become a sanctuary of healing. Together, we will continue to open minds and hearts. We will make the Pulse Memorial a national symbol of hope, love, and light.""
Soto also secured a $40 million loan from Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) funds for Toho Water Utilities to upgrade sewers and protect clean water in Osceola County, including fixing polluted water in St. Cloud. Soto also secured authorization in the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) to convert Taylor Creek in Osceola County to a reservoir to increase local water supply.
117th Congress (2021ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
---
2022) ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Most Productive Congress in 50 Years  
During his third term, Soto served in a unified Democratic government. Under President Joe BidenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs leadership, Soto voted for landmark legislation that made the 117th Congress the most productive in over 50 years. He returned for his second term on the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee and focused on the telecom and technology, environmental protection, and consumer protection subcommittees. He also returned to the Natural Resources Committee to protect FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs environment and tribes, as well as his familyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs native island of Puerto Rico.  
On January 6, 2021, Soto was one of the last Members of Congress trapped in the House Chamber during the violent insurrection. He also witnessed firsthand Vice President Mike Pence gavel down the last objections and certify the results of the election early on the morning of January 7, 2021. He voted for the second impeachment against President Donald Trump in response to his inciting this violent insurrection in a blatant attempt to stop the peaceful transfer of power to incoming President Joe BidenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe lawful winner of the 2020 Presidential Election.  
Soto proudly voted for the American Rescue Plan to help our country continue recovering from the pandemic. This helped put shots in arms, money in pockets, open schools safely, and get Americans back to work.  
He also voted for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to upgrade AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe most significant infrastructure law in over 70 years. Thanks to this legislation, Soto began work with President Biden and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg to secure billions of dollars in federal funding for highway, airport, rail water, broadband internet, and clean energy projects for FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Ninth District.  
He voted for the CHIPS
---
 and Science Act to boost domestic microchip manufacturing and scientific research, which helped him advocate for making NeoCity the biggest CHIPS Act project in the state. Thanks to the ARP and CHIPS Act, Soto would eventually be able to help secure nearly $500 million to further develop NeoCity microchip manufacturing jobs over 10 years, including a $50.8 million Build Back Better Innovation Grant during this term.
During this term, Soto voted for the Honoring Our PACT Act to provide benefits to veterans exposed to burn pits and other toxins during the Global War on Terror (Afghanistan and Iraq) and the Gulf War. It also expanded eligibility of benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. This was the largest increase in veteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ benefits in decades. Soto is proud to represent the Lake Nona VA Hospital and has hosted numerous events there and across Central Florida to educate veterans on their PACT Act benefits eligibility.
He voted for the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to address gun violence, the first gun safety reform in over 30 years. The law offers school safety and mental health grants to reduce gun violence and strengthen communities.
He also voted for the Inflation Reduction Act to lower healthcare costs and combat climate change. The new law made Affordable Care Act health insurance, also known as Obamacare, more affordable. This is critical to FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Ninth District since they have the second-highest Obamacare enrollment in the nation. The law also lowered prescription costs for seniors by finally allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, created a $2,000 annual cap on seniorsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ prescription out-of-pocket expenses, and capped insulin at $35/month. The law also allocated $400 billion in tax incentives to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 203

0, which is the largest investment to combat climate change in U.S. history. The law reduced the costs associated with purchasing electric vehicles, solar panels, energy-efficient appliances, and other products. It encouraged an all-of-the-above clean energy strategy to further develop solar, wind, nuclear, hydroelectric, green hydrogen, carbon capture, fusion, geothermal, and battery storage. It also incentivized private sector industries such as manufacturing, agriculture, energy, construction, and others to reduce emissions.  
After Hurricane Ian, Soto again led the Florida Delegation letter to secure over $10 billion statewide in disaster relief to help Central Florida and other affected areas recover.  
Additionally, Soto passed the bipartisan Restoring Resilient Reefs Act with Florida U.S. Senator Marco Rubio. This law aimed to protect the Great Florida Reef, the third largest reef tract in the world, along with other U.S. reefs. The law nearly tripled federal funding to $45 million/year for five years for technical assistance to states and territories for coral reef restoration, codified the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force, encouraged innovative new coral reef stewardship partnerships, and provided for coral disaster relief grants.  
Soto was also proud to pass the Kissimmee River Wild and Scenic River Act. The Kissimmee River is partly located in FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Ninth District (Osceola and Polk Counties) in the Northern Everglades region. The new law specifically authorized a U.S. Department of Interior study to determine if the Kissimmee River should be a Wild and Scenic River entitled to federal protection. The U.S. and Florida have already spent nearly $1 billion to restore the Kissimmee River and clean water going south to Lake Okeechobee and the Southern Everglades region,

increase water supply, and improve recreation and wildlife habitat.
Soto passed the Territories Health Care Improvement Act out of the Natural Resources Committee to provide equal Medicaid funding for U.S. territories, including his familyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs native island of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and others. The legislation eventually passed in the Omnibus and was critical to equal funding for U.S. Territories, especially protecting access to healthcare for millions of Puerto Ricans in the wake of Hurricane Maria.
Soto finally passed the bipartisan, bicameral National Pulse Memorial bill into law with the help of Senator Rick Scott, honoring the 49 angels and 53 injured in the wake of the Pulse Nightclub terrorist attack. Many of the victims were from the LGBTQ and/or Hispanic communities in the district. This designation is a recognition that this was truly a national tragedy observed and mourned by millions of Americans.
Soto passed the Venezuela TPS Act of 2021 out of the House again during this term and worked with President Biden to secure Temporary Protected Status for over a half million Venezuelans by executive order. With Venezuela in the grips of the violent dictator NicolÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡s Maduro, thousands of Venezuelans fled tyranny to join their existing families, many of whom are citizens and already living in Central Florida.
Soto delivered a $193 million WIFIA loan to fund the Toho One Water Initiative, which will build new reservoirs, conserve our aquifer, and meet future water needs. He also secured WRDA authorization to restore Big Lake Tohopekaliga, Shingle Creek, and Lake Runnymede in Osceola County, $50 million for water storage in Orange County, and $10 million for water storage in Polk County.
In 2021, Congress authorized Community Project Funding requests after

many years. For the 2022 budget, Soto delivered nearly $10 million to fund projects throughout Orange, Osceola, and Polk Counties. These projects included: Clean water restoration for St. Cloud, the restoration of the Berlinsky House in Kissimmee, a community center in Lake Nona, the Hope Rapid Rehousing CenterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂknown as ThriveÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂon S.R. 192, solar for the Valencia College campus in Poinciana, STEM internships at NeoCity Academy, a fire station in Haines City, a Mental Health Crisis Mobile Unit for Polk County, streetscape upgrades for Downtown Lake Wales, and an Intermodal Logistics Center in Winter Haven.  
For the 2023 budget, Soto delivered over $12 million for FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Ninth District. These projects included: An upgrade to Lake NonaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Poitras Park, solar for Orange County Utilities, Hope affordable housing on S.R. 192, the UCF Puerto Rico Research Hub, a Business Academy for Osceola County Public Schools, a Mental Health Crisis Mobile Unit for Polk County, a new fire truck for Haines City, streetscape upgrades for Downtown Lake Wales,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  and a fire engine replacement for Lake Alfred.  
118th Congress (2023ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ2024) ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Soto Thrives in Chaotic GOP Congress  
After a historically productive 117th Congress, billions of dollars in federal funding became available for jobs and infrastructure improvements during the 118th Congress. Soto worked in a bipartisan fashion and closely with the Biden Administration to deliver major projects for Central Florida in the new, slim GOP majority. Soto returned to the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee to work on jobs, technology, consumer protection, environment, healthcare, and other key issues. He also secured a waiver to return to the Agriculture Committee to help negotiate a potential 2024 Farm Bill to help local farmers and ranchers and f

After working on the project for the last three terms, Soto helped secure half of the $3.4 billion needed to complete the Beyond I-4 Ultimate/Moving Florida Forward project thanks to the Infrastructure Law and Amerian Rescue Plan. With the new federal funding, Florida began construction to expand I-4 from just north of S.R. 528 in Orange County, through Osceola County, and to S.R. 27 in Polk County to help improve the commutes of millions of Central Floridians.
Soto also helped secure half of the $1.3 billion needed to build the Poinciana Parkway extension to I-4 (near S.R. 429) thanks to the Infrastructure Law. With new federal funding, Florida began right-of-way acquisition, design, and construction. This project will help Poinciana residents who have some of the most difficult commutes in Central Florida.
Soto also led bipartisan efforts to secure the first $16 million in funding to begin the design of the SunRail/Brightline expansion to Orlando International Airport, a Universal/SeaWorld/North I-Drive Station, a Disney/South I-Drive Station, and connecting Brightline to Tampa. With over $43.5 billion in Intercity Passenger Rail Grants available thanks to the Infrastructure Law, Soto continues to lead a coalition of Central Florida federal, state, and local officials to complete this landmark estimated $6 billion project. He believes in giving Central Floridians options to drive, fly, take the train or bus to keep our fast-growing region moving forward.
Soto has secured over $300 million in federal funding for the expansion of Orlando International Airport, more than any other airport in Florida. This includes finishing Terminal C, adding eight new Terminal C gates, a Terminal C pedestrian bridge, and resurfacing all runways. This was 
---

all made possible due to SotoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs work with President Biden and the Infrastructure Law.
Soto continued the progress at NeoCity for aerospace microchip manufacturing by working with Osceola County and BRIDG to secure a $162 million U.S. National Science Foundation Engine Grant and a $289 million U.S. Department of Defense Cornerstone Grant over 10 years.
Soto secured a $305 million WIFIA loan for the Polk Regional Water Cooperative to support the construction of Lower Floridan Aquifer wellfields and transmission systems. He also landed a $188 million WIFIA loan for Toho Water Authority to continue their One Water Program, which ensures clean water, reduces reliance on the Upper Floridan Aquifer, improves water main and pump stations, and increases water supply.
Soto also helped deliver new high-speed internet access to rural areas of Osceola County like Kenansville, Yeehaw Junction, Deer Park, and Bull Creek thanks to the American Rescue Plan in partnership with the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity. This broadband internet buildout will continue for several years across rural East Orange and South Osceola Counties thanks to the Infrastructure Law.
Thanks to the Infrastructure law, Soto helped Florida receive over $1.1 billion for rural high-speed internet through the BEAD program, $376 million for lead pipe removals, $198 million for electric vehicle charging stations, and many more programs.
Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, Soto is helping incentivize major clean energy projects in the district, like solar manufacturing at Green Garden Village in Poinciana, Florida Power & Light's massive 40,000-acre Solar Plant at El Maximo Ranch in South Osceola, the first Tesla used vehicle dealership in Kissimmee, and the worldÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs largest Tesla supercharger station in Y

eehaw Junction.
The Inflation Reduction Act also made Obamacare more affordable, capped insulin at $35/month, allowed Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices, and capped seniorsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Medicare prescription out-of-pocket expenses at $2,000 per year. Florida has the most Obamacare enrollment in the nation, and FloridaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Ninth District has one of the highest enrollment rates.
For the 2024 budget, Soto delivered nearly $14 million to fund projects throughout Orange, Osceola, and Polk Counties. These projects included: A Kissimmee rapid rehousing center (known as The Haven on Vine), flood control in East Orlando, flood control and a water main in Downtown St. Cloud, flood control for Reaves Road in Poinciana, Daetwyler Drive/ Judge Road intersection improvements in Belle Isle, safety improvements for Marigold Avenue in Poinciana, Orange County GreenPLACE sensitive lands, sidewalk ex",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0

As the Representative for GeorgiaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 10th Congressional District, Mike Collins brings decades of experience as an entrepreneur, businessman, and employer to Congress. He and his wife Leigh Ann started a trucking company in the early 1990s that has grown to employ more than 100 Georgians and hauls freight all over America. Mike has also served on the board and as Chairman of one of GeorgiaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs largest credit unions and president of his local Chamber of Commerce. That experience informs MikeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs top policy priorities, which are to cut wasteful spending and take onerous regulations off the backs of small business owners so our economy can grow and hard-working Americans can thrive.
Representative Collins was born, raised and still resides in Jackson, Georgia. He graduated with a business degree from Georgia State University. He and Leigh Ann have three grown children and four grandchildren.

Bishop, Jr. is serving his seventeenth term in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Georgia's Second Congressional District, which covers 30 Middle and Southwest Georgia counties: Bibb (in part), Baker, Calhoun, Chattahoochee, Clay, Crawford, Decatur, Dooly, Dougherty, Early, Grady, Houston (in part), Lee, Macon, Marion, Miller, Mitchell, Muscogee (in part), Peach, Quitman, Randolph, Seminole, Schley, Stewart, Sumter, Talbot, Taylor, Terrell, Thomas, and Webster.
He is working hard in Congress - across the aisle whenever possible - to create a better quality of life for all citizens, especially Georgians, by promoting jobs and a stronger, more diversified economy, opportunities for rural areas, better education, safe and secure communities, a clean environment, affordable and accessible health care, sustainable agriculture, energy independence, and a strong national defense -- all within the context of a balanced budget.
Congressional Leadership and Legislative Record
Congressman Bishop is a leader among the fiscally responsible Democrats in Congress. He believes that the most important way the nation can reduce the federal budget deficit and grow the economy is to get Americans back to work. He endorsed legislation to increase small business lending, extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to provide tax relief to Americans at all income levels while the economy recovers, reduce the burdensome estate tax, and close tax loopholes that send American jobs overseas. In order to restore the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs economic security, Congress

man Bishop has supported a Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment; legislation to require any new spending by Congress to be offset by spending cuts and/or enhancing revenues; caps on discretionary spending; and reforming defense procurement and weapons acquisition.
Since 2003, Congressman Bishop has served on the House Committee on Appropriations. At the start of the 116th Congress, he was elected by his colleagues to serve as the Chairman Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee and in the 119th Congress he serves as the Subcommittee's Ranking Member, its top Democrat.
He also serves as a senior member of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee and serves on the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee.
As a Member of the House Appropriations Committee, Congressman Bishop has worked to ensure that the Second Congressional District gets its fair share of federal dollars to create and maintain jobs, rebuild its infrastructure, strengthen its schools, bridge the digital divide, fund innovative agriculture research, promote national security, and develop communities.
Prior to 2003, Congressman Bishop served on the House Committee on Agriculture; the House Committee on VeteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Affairs; the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service; and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
Congressman Bishop has spearheaded a wide range of initiatives that benefit the Second Congressional District.
At the outset of the 119th Congress, he re-introduced H.R.333, the Disabled Veterans Tax Termination Act, which would permit retired service members who have a service-connected disability rated less than 50% to receive conc

urrent payment of both retired pay and veteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ disability compensation.
In the 112th Congress, he was the lead House sponsor of the Hiring Heroes Act, which improves programs helping individuals make the transition from service member to civilian employee. The measure was signed into law in November 2011 (P.L. 112-56). In the 111th Congress (2009-2010), Congressman Bishop successfully fought to prevent the U.S. Department of Transportation from banning peanuts on airlines. He also helped over 700 military spouses at Fort Moore (Formerly Ft. Benning) keep their career advancement tuition assistance.
In addition, Congressman Bishop continues to work on estate tax relief and at the outset of the 119th Congress co-led a bipartisan bill, H.R. 601 which would cut the current rate in half.
In 2009, he successfully fought for House passage of legislation to expand the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site in Plains, Georgia. He also worked to promote healthy eating and reduce obesity among the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs youth considering military service.
Congressman Bishop promotes the values and morals of Southwest Georgians ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ ""God, country, work, family, and guns."" He has co-sponsored amendments to the U.S. Constitution protecting the U.S. flag against acts of desecration; ensuring a balanced federal budget; and allowing voluntary, non-denominational prayer in schools and other public places. He also supports the Second Amendment, receiving the grade of ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂA+ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ from the National Rifle Association.
Congressman Bishop has pushed through many other initiatives of special concern to the Second District, including legislation to name the new U.S. Courthouse in Albany for civil rights leader C.B. King and legislation to rename the main post office in Albany for Dr. Walter Carl Gordon, Jr. He has suppo

rted bills to expand and improve the Andersonville Historic Site, as well as efforts to sustain and build new structures at the Second District's military installations, including Fort Moore and the Marine Corps Logistics Base (MCLB) in Albany. He supported the minting of a commemorative coin honoring the United States Army Infantry, and helped fund the construction of the National Infantry Museum and Soldier Center. Finally, he has secured more than a billion dollars in federal grants and loans for communities throughout the Second District, making the area one of the nation's leaders in qualifying for federal community development funding.

ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂHankÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Johnson, Jr. has served GeorgiaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Fourth Congressional District since 2007, currently representing parts of DeKalb and Gwinnett counties. Elected to his 10th term in 2024, he has earned recognition as one of CongressÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs most effective Democrats, championing legislation that strengthens civil rights, consumer protections, judicial transparency and accountability, and community safety.

elligence, and the Internet, Congressman Johnson has been a national leader on court reform, pushing for accountability and ethical standards for Justices seated on the United States Supreme Court. His legislation includes the Judiciary Act, which would have added seats to the U.S. Supreme Court; the TERM Act, which would place term limits on current and future Supreme Court justices; and the Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal and Transparency Act, which would mandate a binding and enforceable code of conduct for justices, with gift and travel reporting requirements equal to those followed by legislative and executive branch officials.
Since his first term, Congressman Johnson has sought to preserve the constitutional right to a trial by jury for consumers and workers by introducing the FAIR Act, which bans the enforcement of forced arbitration clauses in employment and consumer agreements. The FAIR Act passed the House twice and underscores Congressman JohnsonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs commitment to ensuring a fair and level playing field between everyday Americans and wealthy, powerful and well-connected corporations.
Congressman Johnson has also stood against the threat to civil rights caused by unrestrained over-militarization of police departments across the country by authoring the Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act (SMLEA), which would stop the transfer of military grade weaponry from foreign battlefields to our streets. The SMLEA became the basis for Executive Orders issued by the Obama and Biden administrations, and was adopted as part of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
Congressman Johnson has also led legislation that would provide greater public accountability in the use of electronic voting systems for federal elections and championed the prioritization of equity and inclus

ion in the digital space. As a former ranking member on the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law, he has sought to empower minority and underserved communities by advocating for expanded broadband access and policies to close the digital divide.
Since 2007, Congressman Johnson has helped bring more than $5 billion in federal investments back to Georgia, including more than $1 billion specifically for his district ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ funding that was part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act under President Barack Obama and the American Rescue Plan under President Joe Biden. Congressman Johnson has also helped secure more than $175 million for constituents seeking assistance with federal agencies. Congressman Johnson is particularly proud of the constituent services work of his district office, which was ranked number 2 of 435 congressional district offices in the nation.
In 2010, Congressman Johnson was a member of the prosecution team in the impeachment trial of New Orleans U.S. District Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr., resulting in the first impeachment and conviction of a federal judge in more than two decades.
Congressman Johnson was born in Washington, D.C. and earned his B.A. in Political Science from Clark College (now Clark Atlanta University) and his J.D. from the Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University. Prior to Congress, he practiced law for 27 years in Decatur, Georgia, specializing in criminal defense, civil rights, and personal injury law. He also served as a Magistrate Judge for 12 years

and as a DeKalb County Commissioner for five years. He and his wife, DeKalb County Commissioner Mereda Davis Johnson, have two adult children.

Meet Jill
Rep. Jill Tokuda represents Hawai`iÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Second Congressional District (CD2) which includes suburban and rural parts of O`ahu, the islands of Hawai`i, Kaua`i, Maui, Lana`i, Moloka`i, Ni`ihau, Kaho`olawe, and the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.
She serves on the House Committee on Armed Services, Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, and as Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on Conservation, Research, and Biotechnology on the Committee on Agriculture. She is also Co-Chair of the Bipartisan Rural Health Caucus, Second Vice Chair for the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, and Region 2 Whip (includes Hawai`i, Alaska, Northern Califo

rnia, Guam, American Samoa, and The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands).
JillÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs family has called CD2 home for four generations since emigrating from Okinawa, living on Hawai`i Island, Maui, Kaua`i, and on the Windward side of O`ahu. A proud product of Hawai`iÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs public schools, she was the first in her family to go to college and attended The George Washington University where she earned a BA in international relations with a minor in Japanese studies. From 2006-2018, she represented Kaneohe and Kailua in the Hawai`i State Senate. During her tenure she chaired the Ways and Means, Education and Higher Education, Agriculture and Hawaiian Affairs, and Labor committees.
As Ways and Means Chair, Jill balanced the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs $14 billion budget and approved all fiscal and tax measures at the Hawai`i State Legislature. She also championed legislation that established the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first Executive Office on Early Learning and funded the Hawai`i Keiki Program to provide access to health services in public schools.  Jill also passed enabling legislation that allowed for Important Agricultural Lands to be designated and protected. This was an unmet constitutional mandate that took 30 years to pass and places the highest protections on Hawai`iÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs most productive food producing lands.
Her private and nonprofit experience includes serving as Co-Director of CyberHawaii, which supports workforce development, and as the External Affairs Director of the Nisei Veterans Memorial Center where Jill raised funds to expand the facility on the island of Maui. She has served on the board of the Hawai`i Data Collaborative and the advisory board of the Hawai`i Budget and Policy Center. Jill was also a founding member of the Patsy T. Mink PAC, which supports pro-choice women seeking elected offi

Jill is married to Kyle Michibata. They have two sons, Aden and Matt, who attend the same public schools their parents graduated from - King Intermediate and James B. Castle High School.

MikeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs political career began in 1980, when he was elected to the Blackfoot City Council.

Congressional District.
Mike serves as Chairman of the House Interior and Environment Subcommittee on Appropriations. His position gives him the unique opportunity to fight for IdahoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs priorities and ensure IdahoansÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ hard-earned tax dollars come back to Idaho instead of going to states like New York or California.

Brad presently serves on the House Ways and Means and the House Foreign Affairs Committees, and has previously served on the House Judiciary and Small Business Committees.

On Foreign Affairs, Brad is working to ensure democracy is thriving at home and abroad. With competitive threats from Russia, China and Iran, Brad is working with allies to promote the United StatesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ standing on the world stage.

Brad is fighting to protect the Affordable Care Act, Social Security and Medicare, a womanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs right to choose, a healthy, sustainable environment, and full equality for the LGBT+ community.

A strong, independent voice for the Tenth District, Brad has been ranked among the most bipartisan members of Congress.  He is a Chair of the moderate New Democrat Coalition and an active member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. He is also a vice-chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, co-chair of the Bulgaria Caucus and involved with several other important groups such as the Sustainable Energy and Environment Caucus (SEEC), the Pro-Choice Caucus and the House Task Force Combating Antisemitism.

His business career spanned nearly three decades, principally working as a business advisor helping company leaders plan for and realize strategic growth. He also owned and managed a life insurance agency.
Brad and his wife, Julie, have lived in the 10

Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski is a champion for working families, a native of Downstate Illinois and the proud Representative for
IllinoisÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 13th Congressional District
.
Nikki knows that our communities thrive when the middle class is strong. But for too long, working hard and playing by the rules hasnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt been paying off like it should. She believes that families deserve better, and sheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs spent her entire career fighting to help restore the American Dream for people like her grandpa, a union painter, and her grandma, a public school teacher.
After graduating from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Nikki joined the labor movement where she fought to get firefighters, grocery workers and meatpackers better wages, benefits and workplace safety protections. She worked for the Governor of Illinois where she led negotiations to raise IllinoisÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ minimum wage to $15 an hour and chaired the Broadband Advisory Board to expand internet access to rural communities. And she worked at the White HouseÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Office of Management and Budget where she helped implement the American Rescue Plan and establish the Made in America Office to bring jobs home and strengthen our economy.
In 2023, Nikki joined Congress where sheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs continuing her lifelong fight for working people. She serves on the
House Committee on Agriculture
and the
House Committee on VeteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Affairs
to advocate for federal policies that support Illinois family farmers and our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs heroes. She serves as a Vice-Chair of the
Congressional Labor Caucus
where she works to protect workersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ rights and advance the labor movement. SheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs also a memb

er of the
Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition
where she founded the
Climate Jobs Task Force
focused on driving economic development and creating good-paying union jobs while reducing harmful emissions and protecting the environment for future generations.
In all of NikkiÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs efforts to bring the voices of people in Central and Southern Illinois to Washington, sheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs focused on putting their needs over partisan politics, reaching for compromise and delivering results for the communities she serves. SheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs proud to be the Freshman Leadership Representative of the
New Democrat Coalition
ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a group of 100 lawmakers focused on bridging the partisan divide with solutions to the most pressing issues facing our country and our communities. And sheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs been ranked as one of the most bipartisan members of the House of Representatives by the
Common Ground Committee
for her work across the party aisle.

Prior to his election to Congress, LaHood served four years in the Illinois State Senate, beginning in 2011. LaHood spent more than nine years as a State and Federal Prosecutor. From 2001-2006, he worked for the U.S. Department of Justice as an Assistant United States Attorney in Las Vegas, Nevada and was selected as the Chief Terrorism Prosecutor. LaHood has also served as an Assistant State's Attorney in Cook County and Tazewell County. From 2006 up until his election to the House of Representatives, he practiced with the Peoria law firm of Miller, Hall & Triggs.
LaHood currently serves on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee after being selected by his colleagues in January of 2018. The Ways and Means Committee is the HouseÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs oldest committee and has jurisdiction over all taxation and other revenue-raising measures, trade and tariffs, healthcare, and Social Security.

LaHood has been an outspoken advocate for creating a better business climate, reducing our federal deficit, advocating for better international market access for Illinois farmers, lowering taxes for working families, and supporting the needs of rural healthcare providers and patient access. He believes strengthening AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs national security is essential to combat foreign threats from China, Russia, and Iran and making America more competitive globally.
LaHood also serves on the House Democracy Partnership and currently co-chairs the bipartisan US-China Working Group, Digital Trade Caucus, U.S.-Lebanon Friendship Caucus, and Congressional Soccer Caucus.
LaHood, a third-generation Peorian, graduated from Spalding High School. He earned a B.A. from Loras College and holds a J.D. from the University of Illinois-Chicago John Marshall Law School. An enthusiastic athlete, he has completed five marathons and enjoys hiking, biking, and backpacking.

Congressman Eric Sorensen was born and raised in Rockford, Illinois.

To Eric, being a meteorologist was about building trust and protecting his community.
In Congress, Sorensen still values being a trusted neighbor to the residents of IllinoisÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 17th Congressional District.

About

Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson represents Illinois' First Congressional District. Born to civil rights leaders Rev. Jesse Jackson and Jacqueline Jackson, the fight for underrepresented people runs in Congressman Jackson's blood. He has long been an advocate for marginalized communities using his platform to fight for equity and civil rights.
Congressman Jackson's commitment to social justice and equality has been the driving force behind his activism. As the national spokesman for the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Congressman Jackson raised awareness about innocence and juvenile justice issues. He was heavily involved in the Chicago Police Department's false confessions cases, such as those of Darrell Cannon, Oscar Walden, and Johnnie Lee Savory. He played a role in several high-profile human rights and social justice cases, including negotiations with Syrian President Hafez-Al-Assad for the release of captured American Navy Lieutenant Robert Goodman and with Fidel Castro for the release of 22 Americans held in Cuba.

n Jackson values public education and fervently supports expanding opportunities to families regardless of income. In Chicago, he fought against the closure of Chicago Public Schools where he led public hearings and provided civic education training to preserve community memory and prevent closures and turnarounds by private companies. His efforts helped Guggenheim Elementary School come off the closure list in 2010 and saved other schools from the same fate.
Congressman Jackson grew up in ChicagoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs South Shore neighborhood.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  He holds a Bachelor's Degree in Business from North Carolina Agricultural & Technical University and a Master of Business Administration from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Business. Jackson has launched several telecom, distribution, and construction businesses. He has also taught finance and entrepreneurship at Chicago City Colleges and was a business professor at Chicago State University.
Congressman Jackson now brings his activism to Congress. He is committed to promoting policies that advance equality and justice, improving access to quality education and healthcare, and protecting the environment. He proudly serves on the House Committee on Agriculture and on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and is dedicated to working with his colleagues to pass meaningful legislation that will benefit the people of IL-01 and the nation as a whole.

A staunch champion of common sense gun reforms and responsible community policing, Representative Kelly is a Co-Chair of the Congressional Gun Violence Prevention Taskforce and is the author of The 2014 Kelly Report on Gun Violence in America, the first-ever Congressional analysis of the nation's gun violence epidemic that offers a blueprint for ending the crisis.

The daughter of working-class Guatemalan immigrants, Congresswoman Delia C. Ramirez is an accomplished legislator, social service director, community leader, and coalition builder who has dedicated her life and career to advocating for working families. She proudly represents ILÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 3rd Congressional District as the first Latina elected to Congress in Illinois and the entire Midwest. She currently serves on the Committee for Veterans Affairs and is the Vice-Ranking Member of the Committee on Homeland Security.
In Congress, Representative Ramirez is building on the bold and people-centered agenda she championed during her time in the IL General Assembly. As the only member of Congress in a mixed-status family, she is leading the fight for comprehensive immigration reform and finally making a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers like her husband, Boris. Having spent nearly two deca

des in the nonprofit sector, Representative Ramirez understands the challenges working people face every day, which is why she is a staunch advocate of housing as a human right, healthcare for all, climate justice, and the fight to preserve and protect our democracy.
Representative Ramirez's commitment to her community and working families was shaped by her lived experiences as a lifelong resident of ChicagoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Humboldt Park neighborhood. Both of her parents worked low-wage jobs to give their children a fighting chance to escape poverty. The Congresswoman witnessed firsthand how important social services were as she grew up watching neighbors come to her church for housing assistance, food, and services for the undocumented. These experiences ignited a fire, a passion, and a deep commitment to public service.
Representative Ramirez spent the next 18 years as a non-profit leader fighting for housing justice as the Executive Director for the Center for Changing Lives, advocating for good government as the Campaign Manager at Common Cause IL, and championing racial and economic justice initiatives as the Deputy Director of Community Renewal Society. She also served as board chair for both the Latin United Community Housing Association (LUCHA) and Logan Square Neighborhood Association (LSNA), organizations leading the fight for affordable housing, immigration reform, and public education.
In 2018, Representative Ramirez was recruited by community leaders to run for a vacant State Representative seat in the IL 4th House District. She was elected to the Illinois General Assembly, where she served two terms successfully passing legislation expanding Medicaid coverage to IL senior citizens regardless of immigration status, securing over $450 million to build affordable housing,

protecting abortion rights, and creating an elected school board in the City of Chicago. She co-founded the Illinois House Progressive Caucus and rose to become an Assistant Majority Leader during her second term.
Representative Ramirez is a graduate of Northeastern Illinois University and lives in Chicago with her husband, Boris, and their golden retrievers, Lola and Milo.

Fourth Congressional District of Illinois
. He was sworn into office on January 3, 2019, during the 116th Congress.
Throughout his career, Congressman GarcÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ­a has been a progressive voice fighting to improve the lives of his working-class neighbors, many of whom are immigrants like him. He is a coalition builder committed to empowering youth and expanding access to quality education, affordable housing, and economic opportunity.
He currently serves as a member of the
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. He is a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC), Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), the Congressional Equality Caucus, Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus, and New Americans Caucus

Here is the extracted text exactly as provided:

---
. He is also the founder the Future of Transportation Caucus.
Congressman GarcÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ­a was born in Los Pinos, a small village in the Mexican state of Durango. He is the youngest of four children raised by his mother while his father worked in the United States, first under the WWII-era bracero program and later at a cold-storage plant in Chicago. In 1965, Congressman GarcÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ­a and his family immigrated to the United States with permanent resident status. He still remembers his first American meal: a bologna sandwich from a roadside diner in Texas.
Prior to his election to Congress in November of 2018, Congressman GarcÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ­a was a member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. As Commissioner, he opposed housing discrimination against disadvantaged communities, raised the minimum wage, and mandated that County employees have access to paid sick leave. He also passed an ordinance ending Cook County's cooperation with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE). The measure was the first of its kind in the nation and set an example followed by more than 250 localities.
Congressman GarcÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ­a began organizing for workers' rights and more inclusive city services during his college years at University of Illinois in Chicago (UIC). He first entered political life in 1984, when he was elected Committeeman of the Cook County Democratic Party. He quickly earned recognition as a coalition builder between Chicago's Latino and African American communities.
Soon afterward, Congressman GarcÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ­a was elected to represent Chicago's 22nd Ward on the City Council. During his time as Alderman, Congressman GarcÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ­a prevented non-attorney immigration practitioners from levying unreasonable fees. In 1986, he became the Chairman for the Council's Committee on Aviation, where he helped implement the Auto
---
---
mated Guideway Transit (ATG) at O'Hare International Airport.
Mr. GarcÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ­a also served as State Senator of Illinois' 1st District. In 1993, he passed the Language Assistance Services Act, which requires hospitals and long-term care facilities to provide resources for effective communication with limited-English-speaking and deaf patients.
In 2015, Congressman GarcÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ­a became the first Chicago mayoral candidate to push a sitting mayor into a run-off.
Congressman GarcÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ­a still lives in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago with his beloved wife Evelyn and has three adult children.

About The Congressman
As a scientist, clean energy entrepreneur and CEO, and now as a Member of Congress representing the western suburbs of Chicago, Congressman Sean Casten has dedicated his life to fighting climate change. Rep. Casten draws
---
upon his previous private sector experience in Congress to craft market-based solutions to reduce emissions while creating jobs and spurring economic growth.
Rep. Casten sits on both the House Financial Services Committee and the Joint Economic Committee. He also serves as Vice-Chair of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition.
Rep. Casten has a Master of Engineering Management and a Master of Science in Biochemical Engineering from the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College. While at Dartmouth, he did fundamental research in thermophilic fermentation technology to produce cellulosic ethanol and engineering analyses of integrated ethanol, heat, and power plants.
Casten worked as a clean energy consultant and manager at Arthur D. Little, then served as the president and CEO of Turbosteam Corporation, which focused on utilizing energy recycling technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by generating heat and power from previously wasted energy.

About Jan  
Image  
Jan Schakowsky was elected to represent Illinois' 9th Congressional District in 1998, after serving for eight years in the Illinois State Assembly. She is in her fourteenth term.  
Schakowsky serves in the House Democratic Leadership as a Chief Deputy Whip. She is a member of the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where she serves as the Ranking Member on the Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade Subcommittee, as well as the Environment Subcommittee.  
In 2010, Speaker Pelosi appointed Schakowsky to serve on President Obama's 18-member National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. She opposed the deficit reduction proposal presented by co-chairs Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson and offered her own approach, which reached the same fiscal goals without cutting Social Secu

rity, Medicare or Medicaid. The Schakowsky plan addressed the real and growing problem of income disparity ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ which is at its greatest level since 1928 ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and protects middle-class families.
In Congress, Schakowsky focuses on health care and senior issues. She was a leader in passing the historic Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to provide healthcare coverage to all Americans. Schakowsky was responsible for provisions in the law to require improved review of insurance company premiums, nursing home quality protections, and initiatives to increase the number of health care providers, which benefit seniors and all Americans. A champion for the nation's seniors, Schakowsky continues the fight to prevent the privatization of Social Security and Medicare, and to make prescription drugs more affordable. She spearheaded the creation of the Seniors Task Force in the 111th Congress and continues to serve as Co-Chair in the 119
th
Congress in the now-renamed Task Force on Aging and Families.
Schakowsky believes the number one priority in this Congress is to create jobs and restore a vibrant middle class. She has introduced the Patriot Corporations of America Act to reward companies that hire American workers and to eliminate tax incentives to businesses for sending jobs overseas. She introduced the Fairness in Taxation Act to create higher tax brackets for millionaires and billionaires.
A leading advocate for women's issues in Congress, Schakowsky has long been involved in the fight to protect women's reproductive freedom. She continues her work to prevent violence against immigrant women, achieve economic parity, and establish transitional housing for women and children who are victims of abuse. Schakowsky is the sponsor of the International Violence Against Women Act, w

hich would make the safety of women and girls around the world a long-overdue U.S. foreign policy priority.
Schakowsky has consistently voted for measures to support Israel's peace and security. She strongly supports helping Israel reach a negotiated two-state solution with the Palestinians. As a Jewish Congresswoman, Schakowsky has a deep personal connection to the State of Israel and pledges a continued friendship. Schakowsky also worked closely with President Barack Obama to assure completion of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) designed to cut off all Iranian pathways to a nuclear weapon.
Throughout her time in Congress, Schakowsky has won major legislative victories. These include important provisions in the Affordable Care Act, as well as laws that protect seniors, from abusive terms in reverse mortgages, require greater transparency for military contractors, require the strongest possible mandatory safety standards and testing for infant and toddler products ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ including high chairs, cribs and bath seats ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and require strict car safety measures to protect children.
A longtime grassroots organizer and consumer advocate, Schakowsky began her leadership career in 1969 when she led the fight that put freshness dates on products sold in the supermarket. Prior to her election to Congress, Schakowsky represented the 18th District in the Illinois General Assembly for eight years. She served as a Democratic Floor Leader and as Secretary of the Conference of Women Legislators.
For twenty years before her election to the Illinois State House, Schakowsky fought for the public interest and rights of Illinois citizens. As Program Director of Illinois Public Action from 1976 to 1985 ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the state's largest public interest organization ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Schakowsky fought for energy re

form and stronger protection from toxic chemicals. As Director of the Illinois State Council of Senior Citizens from 1985 to 1990, she organized across the state for lower cost prescription drugs and tax relief for seniors, financial protection for the spouses of nursing home residents and other benefits for the elderly.
Jan lives in Evanston, Illinois, with her husband Robert Creamer and their two energetic rescue dogs, Franklin and Eleanor (Frankie and Ellie for short). She has three children, Ian, Mary, and stepdaughter Lauren Travers, and six grandchildren, Isaac, Stevie, Lucy, William, Aidan and Alice. She graduated from the University of Illinois in 1965 with a B.S. in Elementary Education.

Victoria Spartz Official Photo
Congresswoman Victoria Spartz immigrated to the United States in 2000 after meeting her husband Jason, a born and raised Hoosier, on a train in Europe. She became a US Citizen and worked her way up from being a bank teller to a CPA, finance executive, successful business owner, and Indiana State Senator.
Growing up in Ukraine molded her conservative political philosophy that limited government is always better, and financial and healthcare decisions should be made by individuals in the free market, not bureaucrats and special interests.
Rep. Spartz worked in the Big 4 public accounting firms for Fortune 500 companies, taught as an adjunct faculty member at Indiana UniversityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Kelley School of Business, and served as the CFO at the Indiana Attorney GeneralÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Office. She also started several businesses in financial consulting, farming, and real estate.
Rep. Spartz earned a Bachelor of International Economics and Master of Business Administration from the National University of Economics in Ukraine as well as a Master of Professional Accountancy from the Indiana University Kelley School of Business in Indianapolis. She also completed the Harvard Business School Executive Education program on health care.

Carson has served in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2008. Throughout his time in office, Congressman Carson has established himself as an influential leader and respected public servant, fighting for good paying jobs, economic growth, and safer communities for Indiana's working families.


Congressman Carson consistently fights for the middle class, securing hundreds of millions for investments in public safety, education, infrastructure, and the creation and protection of thousands of good paying jobs. Additionally, the congressman has made accessibility a priority for his office, holding regular meetings around Indianapolis and hosting Congress on Your Corner events to ensure constituents have easy access to the resources and information they need.

Since being elected to Congress, Congressman Carson has joined a number of caucuses, coalitions, and tasks forces that focus on some of the issues that he considers to be top priorities in the 7th District and around the country. Together with other like-minded Members of Congress, he has worked to bring about solutions to some of the most important issues facing our city and nation. Some of his memberships include: the Congressional Black Caucus, the Progressive Caucus, the New Democrat Coalition, and the LGBT Equality Caucus.

In Washington, Congressman Carson fought to pass the historic health care reform law, which provides families and businesses with better health insurance options and makes health care more affordable and accessible for tens of millions of Americans. As a former member of the House Financial Services Committee, he also helped pass Wall Street Reform, which protects consumers by ending government bailouts and the risky lending practices that almost destroyed our economy.

Congressman Carson is the first Muslim to serve on the House Intelligence Committee, where he continues to serve to this day. As Chairman of the House Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence, and Counterproliferation Subcommittee, Congressman Carson oversaw the first congressional hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAPs) in more than 50 years. Congressman Carson continues to serve a vital role in ensuring dedicated intelligence personnel have the tools and resources needed to keep America safe and that their activities are in the best interest of its people.

In addition to the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Carson also presently serves on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, sitting on the Aviation and the Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Subcommittees, and the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, a Bipartisan effort to build consensus on the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party and develop a plan of action to defend the American people, our economy, and our values. 

A rising member of House leadership, Congressman Carson serves as a Senior Whip for the House Democratic Caucus. This high-profile position allows him to fight for Indiana's 7th Congressional District at the highest levels of congressional leadership. 

As one of four Muslims serving in Congress, Congressman Carson is a champion for vulnerable populations and is committed to the goal of equal protection under the law. He has long been involved in the fight to achieve gender fairness, religious freedom, and LGBTQ equality.

Congressman Carson is a proud Indianapolis native, having grown up on the city's east side. He is a graduate of Arsenal Tech High School, and he holds a Bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice Management from Concordia University-Wisconsin and a Master's in Business Management from Indiana Wesleyan University.

Before taking office, Congressman Carson served on the Indianapolis City-County Council and worked full-time in law enforcement. He also worked in intelligence and counter-terrorism for the Indiana Department of Homeland Security and served at the Indiana Intelligence Fusion Center. There he worked in an anti-terrorism unit to protect Indianapolis and the United States from terrorist threats at home and abroad.

MariannetteÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs father was a Master Sergeant in the United States Air Force who was forced to take up extra work, sometimes two or three jobs, to support their family. Her mother, who did not have a high school education, also worked multiple jobs.  
Mariannette originally dreamed of becoming a teacher because she loved school and wanted to share her passion for learning with others. However, in 10th grade, she was severely burned in a kitchen fire. While at the hospital, Mariannette was treated by a physical therapist who went out of her way to make sure she got better. This womanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs kindness and selflessness inspired her to become a doctor so she could help others.  
Mariannette was the fourth of eight children and since her parents did not have the means to pay for college, she left home at 16 and enrolled in community college. She later enlisted in the United States Army at 18, where she served for 24 years as a private, nurse, and doctor (ophthalmologist or eye diseases/surgery.) She went into private practice in Ottumwa in 1997 and she has remained there with her husband, Curt.

As a mother of two, she also has a keen interest in protecting the safety and security of Iowa families.

AshleyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs extensive reporting on rising healthcare costs, devastating flooding, and other critical issues impacting Eastern Iowa drove her to seek opportunities to better serve her community and take action to solve the problems she had covered for years.
While working as a reporter, Ashley earned recognition as a two-time Midwest regional Emmy award winner, an RTDNA Health Reporting Fellow, and a Waypoint Tribute to Women Honoree. She received her B.A. in Broadcast Journalism from the University of Southern California before returning home to Iowa to work and raise a family.

Tracey Mann has represented the ""Big First"" District of Kansas in the U.S. House of Representatives since January 2021 and is a tireless advocate for Kansas agriculture and conservative Kansas values.
Congressman Mann is a fifth-generation Kansan, who was born and raised on his family farm just south of Quinter. He grew up in the family farmhouse that his great-great-grandfather ordered from a Montgomery Ward catalog in the early 1900s. Congressman Mann learned the value of hard work at a young age as he spent thousands of hours in the fields and in the family feed yard. Some of his fondest memories of those days are working cattle with his grandfather, father, and brother on Saturday afternoons while listening to K-State football on the radio.
Congressman Mann proudly serves on the House Agriculture and House Transportation and Infrastructure committees.
Prior to representing the First District, Congressman Mann served Kansas as the 50th Lt. Governor of Kan

Ron Estes
(pronounced ESS-tiss)
is a 5th generation Kansan and serves KansasÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 4th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives. Since being sworn into office in 2017, Congressman Estes has been a leader on passing landmark tax reform, rolling back burdensome regulations and implementing trade agreements with some of KansasÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ biggest trading partners. In Congress, Rep. Estes has defended WichitaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs aviation industry, helped pass a five-year Farm Bill to support Kansas agriculture, protected the 4th DistrictÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs water supply and quality of life, and led efforts to secure new pro-life guidelines for the Title X Family Planning Program.
The son of a veteran, Rep. Estes has also prioritized supporting our military and military families, while helping veterans and constituents navigate government agencies like the VA, Social Security Administration, the IRS and others.

That experience in the private sector has helped position Rep. Estes as a committed advocate for Kansas taxpayers in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Following his private sector career, Rep. Estes served his fellow Kansans as Sedgwick County (Kansas) Treasurer and then Kansas State Treasurer. As the only former state treasurer serving on the Committee on Ways and Means, Rep. Estes remains a champion of lower taxes, free and fair trade, affordable health care, and retirement security.

James Comer was elected to Congress in 2016 to represent the 1st Congressional District, which covers 35 counties from the Mississippi River to Central Kentucky. He currently serves as the Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, where he aggressively advocates for reducing waste, fraud and abuse in government.
Comer grew up in Monroe County and attended Western Kentucky University to study agriculture. Shortly thereafter, Comer entered the business world, taking out a loan and purchasing his farm.
In 2000, Comer was elected to serve the first of six terms in the Kentucky House of Representatives.With a reputation for a solid work ethic and conservative values, he was named National Republican Freshman
---
---
Legislator of the Year during his first term.
Comer was elected to serve as Kentucky's Commissioner of Agriculture in 2011, and inherited growing problems at the Kentucky Department of Agriculture. He immediately set out to work in a bipartisan way to clean up scandal, restore confidence, and crack down on waste, fraud, and abuse at the agency. Comer spearheaded initiatives to grow Kentucky's rural economy and increase opportunities for Kentucky farmers, while also standing up for taxpayers by selling unneeded equipment and returning money to the state treasury.
After his election to Congress in 2016, Comer immediately set out to replicate his record of conservative accomplishment in Washington. This includes serving as a member of the 2018 Farm Bill Conference Committee that negotiated an agreement to pass a farm bill making vital improvements to America's agricultural economy. He serves as the only formerly-elected Commissioner of Agriculture in Congress and remains active on policy matters facing the farm community.
Comer has also worked tirelessly to advance legislation protecting school meal access for students during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as on legislation reauthorizing the Older Americans Act and the Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. He has also championed legislation to reduce burdensome regulations and boost government transparency, and is an advocate for balancing the federal budget and reducing wasteful spending.
In addition to serving as Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, he is also a member of the House Committee on Education and Workforce.
He is married to TJ Comer and they have three children - Reagan, Harlan and Aniston.

ngress in 2022 and currently serves on the Veterans Affairs, Small Business and Budget Committees. In his first term, Congressman McGarvey was the first Freshman Democrat to pass a bill out of the House ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a bill supporting and protecting veteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ earned educational benefits.

Born in rural Kentucky and representing one of the poorest Congressional Districts in the nation, RogersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ vision for a stronger region spurred some of the greatest success stories in southern and eastern Kentucky. Organizations such as
Operation UNITE

,
The Center for Rural Development
,
Eastern Kentucky PRIDE
and
Shaping Our Appalachian Region (SOAR)
, have brought local communities together by revitalizing the environment, providing hope in the fight against drugs, supporting small business owners, and creating jobs and new innovative opportunities in one of the most beautiful parts of the country.
Nationally, as Chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee from 2011 through 2016, he reduced the size and scope of government by reining in federal spending, conducting rigorous but thoughtful oversight of federal agencies, and restoring fiscal discipline and transparency to our budget process. Chairman Rogers led the Congress to reduce discretionary spending by a historic amount, cutting $126 billion in discretionary spending. During his tenure, Chairman Rogers led the way for regular order, conducting 650 oversight hearings and considering more than 2,000 amendments to appropriations bills on the floor.
With 40 years of experience on the Appropriations Committee, he has served on more than ten different subcommittees, including leadership roles as Chairman or Ranking Member of six. Notably, Rogers was tapped in 2003 to lead the first Subcommittee on Homeland Security. Through this imp

Whether Rogers is on Capitol Hill ensuring the appropriate use of taxpayer dollars, fighting to secure the homeland, scrutinizing federal government agencies, or home in southern and eastern Kentucky working to make a difference in the lives of the individuals he represents, Rogers remains committed to being a strong voice in Congress for fiscal responsibility, economic development, a strong national defense, and a prosperous future for America.

Congressman Barr is in his second term on the House Foreign Affairs Committee where he serves on the Indo-Pacific Subcommittee.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  In addition, Congressman Barr was appointed to serve on the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the 118th Congress.

During his time in Congress, Congressman Barr has been a champion for Kentucky families, farmers, and small business owners, fighting to keep taxes low and against overly burdensome regulations.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congressman Barr was a key architect of the Paycheck Protection Program, which delivered forgivable loans to small busine

Steve Scalise proudly represents the First Congressional District of Louisiana, stretching from the beautiful Northshore of Lake Pontchartrain and the culturally distinct New Orleans suburbs to the vibrant bayous and wetlands abundant in natural resources. He was elected to Congress in 2008 after serving in the Louisiana State Legislature from 1996-2008.
Scalise served as House Majority Whip from 2014-2018 and as House Minority Whip from 2019-2022, where he was responsible for unifying the Republican Conference as legislation moved through the House of Representatives.
For 118th and current 119th Congresses, Scalise was elected House Majority Leader by his colleagues, the second highest position in House Republican Leadership.
Scalise keeps a pulse on what is happening in communities across the United States and responds accordingly. As Majority Leader, Scalise is responsible for the day-to-day workings of the House of Representatives and helps Republicans communicate their priorities to the American people.

Conservative Leader
Scalise is a strong leader who upholds the Constitution and advocates for the principles of fiscal discipline, lower taxes, a robust national defense, strong border security, freedom, and conservative values.
From passing the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the USMCA trade dealÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwhich were both major boosts to our economyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂand legislation to keep schools safely open, Scalise is focused on the issues that impact Americans most.

Scalise knows the importance of energy development to Louisiana and the need to get back to American energy dominance. He is fighting to enact a national energy strategy that increases the supply of American energy through enhanced production and technological innovation to lower prices at the pump across the country and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
Champion for Louisiana
Scalise is effective at working with Republican and Democrat colleagues to pass legislation critical to Louisiana. A steadfast defender of LouisianaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs coast, Scalise led the effort to pass the RESTORE Act, which was signed into law in 2012. The RESTORE Act dedicated the vast majority of Clean Water Act fines from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to coastal restoration. The legislation is widely regarded as the single most significant action taken to restore Louisi

anaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs coast. Majority Leader Scalise is also a strong supporter of energy revenue sharing and leads the fight in Washington to protect LouisianaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs GOMESA funding, ensuring Louisiana has access to hundreds of millions of dollars dedicated to restoring its coast.
Fighter
Critically wounded at a Congressional baseball practice on June 14, 2017, Scalise was saved by a heroic response from U.S. Capitol Police special agents and Alexandria Police officers. Scalise fought for his life and returned to Congress, inspiring the nation with his resilience and optimism. Throughout his recovery, he was moved by the outpouring of prayers and support he and his family received from the American people.
A native of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, Scalise graduated from Archbishop Rummel High School and Louisiana State University, where he earned a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Political Science. Scalise and his wife, Jennifer, have two children, Madison and Harrison.

After a tenure of less than 6.8 years in the House, Mike was given the honor faster than any person in history except for Speaker John G. Carlisle in 1883, who had previously served for only 6.75 years. He was reelected on January 3, 2025, to continue serving as Speaker of the House for the 119  
th  
Congress. As a Member of Congress, he represents the nearly 760,000 residents of 20 parishes in the northwest, northeast, and western regions of his state. Mike was first elected to Congress on December 10, 2016, by the largest margin of victory in his region in more than 50 years and is currently serving in his fifth term in Congress.

With two decades of previous experience in Constitutional law, Mike previously served on the House Judiciary Committee, and as chairman of its Subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government. He also served as a leader on the Select Committee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, the House Natural Resources Committee, and the House Armed Services Committee. His district includes important military installations, including Barksdale Air Force Base, headquarters of the Air Force Global Strike Command, and Fort Johnson (formerly Fort Polk) and the Army's Joint Readiness Training Center, as well as the Louisiana National Guard's Camp Minden Training Site and other assets.
Mike is a dedicated husband and father  and an attorney who has devoted his life and career to fighting for the fundamental freedoms and traditional values that have made America the greatest nation in the history of the world. He spent nearly 20 years successfully litigating high profile constitutional law cases in district and appellate courts nationwide, and previously served in the Louisiana Legislature (2015-17).
The eldest son of a Shreveport firefighter who was critically burned and permanently disabled in the line of duty, Mike learned early on the values of hard work, honor, and sacrifice. He has a practical understanding of the challenges that small business owners face because he, like his parents and grandparents, is one himself. Mike has also been a college professor, conservative talk radio host and columnist, a media spokesman for AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs largest religious liberty organizations, a constitutional law seminar instructor, a

About Chellie  
Download an Official Headshot  
Chellie Pingree never anticipated a life in politics. Living on the offshore island of North Haven, Maine, she raised her kids and ran a small business. She served on the school board and as the local tax assessor, a job no one else in town wanted. But in 1991, when she was approached about running for State Senate, she jumped at the chance.  
She scored a remarkable upset, defeating a popular Republican, and went on to serve four terms in the Maine Senate. But throughout her political career, from Augusta to Washington and beyond, the lessons she learned on North Haven h
---
ave always been her guide: Be accountable to your neighbors, and always use your common sense.
Chellie Johnson (she has legally changed her name from ""Rochelle"") was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1955, the youngest of four children. Her father, Harry, worked in advertising and her mother, Dorothy, was a nurse. Chellie moved to Maine as a teenager, attended the University of Southern Maine, and graduated from the College of the Atlantic, in Bar Harbor. After college, she moved to North Haven, an island town of 350 people twelve miles off the coast of Rockland, to raise her family and make a living.
Farmer & Small-Business Owner Turned State Senator
Chellie has worked hard throughout her life - as a mother, as a farmer, as a small business owner, and in politics. She knows how difficult it can be to meet payroll and run a business in a small, rural community. Right after college, Chellie and her husband, Charlie, spent several years running a small farm and selling produce locally. In 1981, she started North Island Yarn, a cottage industry of local knitters, with a retail store on the island. The business expanded quickly, becoming North Island Designs, and employed as many as ten local workers in peak seasons. The business sold knitting kits and pattern books nationwide through 500 retail stores and 100,000 mail order catalogues. She sold the business in 1993.Today, in addition to her political life, Chellie co-owns and helps manage Nebo Lodge, a bed & breakfast and restaurant on North Haven, which she started with several partners in 2006.
Chellie was elected to the Maine State Senate in 1992, representing Knox County. In 1996, Chellie was chosen by her peers to be the Maine Senate Majority Leader. She helped lead the Senate for four more years, until leaving offic

e due to term limits. As a Senator, she fought for economic and social justice, taking on powerful adversaries - most notably the pharmaceutical lobby. In her last session, Pingree sponsored one of the nation's first prescription drug pricing bills, MaineRX. After a legal fight that led all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, the bill became law, and has since been a model for states around the country working to lower prescription drug prices.
Chellie also sponsored the successful ""Parents as Scholars"" program, a national model for welfare reform, which continues to help working Maine parents gain access to education to help them achieve a better life for their families. She led successful efforts to protect Maine's environment, for corporate accountability, to protect workers, to promote a women's right to choose, and in support of Maine's small businesses. As a state Senator, Chellie was also a founding member of the Maine Economic Growth Council.Pingree's leadership in Maine politics led to numerous international appointments. She traveled to Hungary as an Eisenhower Exchange Fellow, served as a member of the White House delegation to observe elections in Bosnia, and was a member of a U.S. delegation to Northern Ireland, working with women political leaders there.
After being term-limited from the Maine Senate in 2000, Pingree challenged incumbent U.S. Senator Susan Collins in 2002. As one of the few outspoken opponents of the Iraq War running for U.S. Senate, Chellie mounted a strong, but ultimately unsuccessful campaign.
From 2003 to 2007, Chellie served as the National President and CEO of Common Cause, a non-partisan citizen activist group with nearly 300,000 members and 35 state chapters. Common Cause's mission is to help citizens make their voices heard in the
---
political process and to hold their elected leaders accountable to the public interest. Under Chellie's leadership, Common Cause increased its membership and diversified its agenda to include limiting media concentration and consolidation, promoting Net Neutrality, and election reform, while continuing to pursue its traditional goals of campaign finance reform and oversight of government ethics and accountability.
A Fighter in Congress
In 2008, Chellie was elected to Congress from MaineÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 1st Congressional DistrictÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe first woman elected to Congress from that District. She has previously served on the House Rules Committee and Armed Services Committee. She currently sits on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, chairing the Subcommittee on Interior and the Environment, the Subcommittee on Agriculture, and Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. She also sits on the House Agriculture Committee.
Among other issues important to Mainers, Chellie has been an advocate in Congress for reforming federal policy to better support the diverse range of American agricultureÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂincluding sustainable, organic, and locally focused farmingÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂas well as to reduce food waste. Many provisions from comprehensive legislation she introduced to make these reforms were passed in both the 2014 and 2018 Farm Bills. She received a 2017 James Beard Leadership Award for her national leadership in food system reform.
Chellie has also been recognized for her leadership on a number of other issues, including assisting survivors of military sexual trauma, strengthening the creative and arts economy, and helping coastal communities address threats to their future.
Chellie has three grown children--Asa, Cecily, and Hannah, former Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.

The son of immigrants who fled communist Eastern Europe immediately after World War II, Dr. Andy Harris was a physician at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, a medical officer in the Naval Reserve, and a state senator before coming to Congress.
Born in Brooklyn in 1957, he studied medicine at Hopkins, where he continued to practice as an anesthesiologist for nearly three decades. Andy specialized in obstetric anesthesiology.
In 1988, Andy answered a recruitment call to fill a critical need for anesthesiologists in the Naval Reserve during the Reagan administration. He went on to establish and command The Johns Hopkins Medical Naval Reserve Unit. In 1990, his unit was called up to active duty in order to assist with Operation Desert Shield (and later Operation Desert Storm) at Bethesda Naval Hospital. Harris attained the rank of Commander (O-5) before leaving the Reserves after seventeen years.
Unhappy with the status quo in Annapolis, Andy decided to take on the establishment and run for the Maryland State Senate in 1998, where he served for 12 years.  MarylandÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs First Congressional District first elected Andy to serve i

Andy lives with his wife, Nicole, and their dog in Dorchester County. In his free time, he enjoys spending time on the Chesapeake Bay with his family and repairing old cars with his sons.

Congressman Johnny ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂJohnny OÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Olszewski, Jr. proudly represents MarylandÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 2nd District, which includes major portions of Baltimore County, Carroll County, and parts of Baltimore City.
A lifelong Marylander who believes in the power of public service, Olszewski is a former public-school teacher, has prior service in the Maryland House of Delegates, and was twice elected as Baltimore County Executive, where he led the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs third-largest jurisdiction and managed a $5 billion government enterprise.
In the state legislature, Olszewski became the youngest person ever elected Chairman of the Baltimore County House Delegation. A staunch advocate for working families, Olszewski led efforts to provide earned sick leave, raise the minimum wage, and served as a defining vote to secure marriage equality in the State of Maryland.
As County Executive, Olszewski worked to build a better Baltimore County, committing record funding for public education and providing near-universal free community college for county residents. Olszewski made open, transparent, and accountable government a signature of his administration, creating the countyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first publi

c campaign finance system, establishing the countyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first Office of the Inspector General, and launching a signature series of annual Budget Town Hall meetings.
During his tenure, he also led the charge that lead to enactment of bipartisan police reform; passage of bipartisan gun safety legislation; the establishment of the CountyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first dedicated Department of Housing and Community Development; the launching of Baltimore CountyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first free, fixed-route public transportation service; all the while making record investments in public parks and open space. Olszewski also led widely-praised local government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and the tragic collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge.
A product of public schools and a first-generation college graduate, Olszewski holds a bachelorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree from Goucher College, a masterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree from George Washington University, and a Ph.D. from the University of Maryland Baltimore County.
Olszewski lives in eastern Baltimore County with his wife, Marisa, his daughter, Daria, and their rescue dog, Yachty.

Congressman Glenn Ivey is an attorney who served on Capitol Hill as chief counsel to the Senate Majority Leader, as counsel to Senator Paul Sarbanes during the Whitewater investigations, Chief Majority Counsel to the Senate Banking Committee, and on the staff of Rep. John Conyers (D-MI).ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  He also worked for U.S. Attorney Eric Holder as an assistant U. S. Attorney, and as chair of MarylandÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Public Service Commission. He was twice elected as State's Attorney for Prince George's County where he worked with the Obama Administration to cut crime.
Congressman Ivey established Ivey & Levetown in 2020, and recently represented a Lafayette Square protestor, arguing that the facial recognition software used to identify him compounds discrimination against dark-skinned people. The Department of Justice threw out the case. As chair of the County Executive Angela AlsobrooksÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Police Reform Taskforce in 2020 Ivey led the committee that examined the police

Ivey grew up in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, where the schools of his hometown were still segregated when he started attending. But he watched his mother, a librarian, desegregate four different white schools, as well as his father, who worked for a federal War on Poverty agency that helped unemployed workers in eastern North Carolina get job training and find jobs.
It was then Ivey saw the power of public service and the impact that advocates can have on social justice. And ever since, he has been a tireless fighter for our community. As Prince George's County State's Attorney, he created a first-of-its-kind Domestic Violence Prosecution Unit and pushed for stronger witness intimidation penalties. When the real estate market went south, he established an award-winning mortgage fraud unit that stood up for homeowners.
Ivey resides in Prince GeorgeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs County with his wife, Jolene, a County Councilmember. He has six kids, one daughter, and five sons. His son, Julian, serves as a Delegate for District 47A in the Maryland House of Delegates. Ivey is a graduate of Princeton University (A.B. 1983) and Harvard Law School (J.D. 1986).

Always Advocating for His Constituents
In Maryland's Fifth Congressional District, Congressman Steny H. Hoyer is a tireless fighter for economic development and a leader in creating jobs. He has helped create and save nearly 23,000 jobs by supporting federal facilities and associated businesses located in and around the Fifth District, including NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Patuxent River Naval Air Station, the Naval Surface Warfare Center at Indian Head, the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, the FDA at White Oak, and the future NOAA Center for Weather and Climate Prediction in College Park.
He also fights to protect our natural resources. In addition to supporting every major piece of environmental legislation while in Congress, he has co-sponsored numerous bills to protect the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, including the ""Chesapeake Bay Restoration Act.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ He secured more than $10 million in the 1990s to respond to Pfiesteria and to study its effects on humans; helped secure more than $400 million in the 2008 Farm Bill to enable farmers to implement environmental best practices and reduce runoff into the Chesapeake Bay; and championed the efforts to replenish the declining oyster population of the Bay and to restore the Potomac, Patuxent and St. Mary's rivers.
Congressman Hoyer works to meet the transportation needs of his constituents by securing funding to maintain and improve local roads, commuter bus systems, and the Washington Me

tropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). He also works to keep local communities and the Washington region safe by fighting to fully fund Community Oriented Policing Services, the Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program, and upgrades for first respondersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ communications systems.  
Congressman Hoyer is also dedicated to outstanding constituent service. At offices in Washington, D.C., Greenbelt, and Waldorf, he and his staff help constituents cut through red tape and solve problems related to passports, immigration, government services, and a host of other issues.  

A Record of Achievement  
In Congress, Steny Hoyer has built an outstanding record of achievement and earned a reputation as an effective leader and an able legislator. In the 111th Congress, his skill at consensus-building helped the House pass important legislation to strengthen our economy and bring health coverage to an additional 4 million low-income children through the State ChildrenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Health Insurance Program. He remains a leading voice in Congress for fiscal responsibility and a government that pays for what it buys. Additionally, through the Make It In America plan he launched in 2010, Congressman Hoyer has spearheaded efforts to invest in creating new opportunities for businesses, workers, and families in Maryland and across the country.  

Congressman Hoyer shepherded the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) to overwhelming approval in the House in 1990. This landmark civil rights legislation, signed into law on July 26, 1990 by President George H.W. Bush, has helped millions of disabled Americans enter the workforce, achieve independence, and go as far as their talents take them. In 2008, Congressman Hoyer also led the effort to pass the ADA Amendments Act, which allows millions of Americans with disa
---
bilities to benefit from the ADAÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs original intent of inclusion.
Congressman Hoyer also gained wide acclaim for guiding the Help America Vote Act to House passage and for producing a House-Senate Conference Report that was signed into law by President George W. Bush on Oct. 29, 2002. Washington Post columnist David Broder called this comprehensive election reform legislation ""the most significant piece of election law since [the] Voting Rights Act.""
In addition, Congressman Hoyer drafted and helped secure passage of the Federal Employee Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA). FEPCA, which was signed into law in November 1990, was a major effort to restructure the pay system for Federal employees, which attempts to ensure fairness in pay and comparability to similar work outside the Federal government.
Congressman Hoyer also is a widely respected voice on foreign policy and international affairs. As the former Chair and Ranking Democrat on the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (the Helsinki Commission), he championed the cause of human rights, individual freedoms, democracy and religious liberties throughout the world. He called for decisive U.S. and NATO action to stop the carnage throughout the former Yugoslavia and condemned the repressive tactics of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Even before the September 11
th
terror attacks, Congressman Hoyer recognized the danger posed by the Taliban's regime. He also has taken a very active role in urging international action to stop the genocide in Sudan, and in April 2007 led a Congressional delegation to Darfur. On May 21, 2009, Denmark honored Congressman Hoyer by making him a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog.
A staunch advocate for supporting America's democratic allies abroad, Congressman Hoyer has been a steadfast s

upporter for aiding Ukraine in the wake of Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and subsequent invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Congressman Hoyer has also worked tirelessly to strengthen the crucial U.S.-Israel relationship throughout his career in Congress, visiting the country twenty times over the year. He has sought to maintain Congress' overwhelming bipartisan support for Israel ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ especially in the wake of the brutal Hamas terror attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023.  
Through his committee assignments and leadership positions, Congressman Hoyer has aggressively advocated for his Fifth District constituents. As a member of the Appropriations Committee from the time he took office until he entered the Congressional leadership, Congressman Hoyer has secured funding for numerous important projects in Calvert, Charles, Prince GeorgeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs, Anne Arundel, and St. Mary's counties and throughout the State of Maryland. He also has worked to ensure that the military bases in the Fifth District not only survived base closings but grew and thrived.  
On the Transportation, Treasury and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, Congressman Hoyer became widely recognized as a national leader on issues affecting Federal employees and retirees. In addition to guiding FEPCA to passage, he fights year in and year out for fair pay and benefits for Federal employees, and he has secured funding for telecommuting centers that save money and reduce traffic congestion.  
He also has been a strong proponent of Federal law enforcement efforts that fall within the Subcommittee's jurisdiction, securing funding for innovative crime-fighting projects such as the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program, Gang Resistance Education and Treatment Program, and the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction

Initiative. In addition, he is a long-time supporter of the COPS on the Beat Program, which has meant more than $30 million in Federal funding to hire an additional 700 police officers in the Fifth District.
On the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, Congressman Hoyer championed education and funding for the Class Size Reduction Initiative, Head Start, and teacher training programs. He has also been an advocate for increased funding for childhood immunization and for full-service community schools, which provide a range of important services for students, especially in early childhood years.
Congressman Hoyer is well-recognized for his efforts to make the House more efficient and ""customer friendly.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ As the former Ranking Democrat on the Committee on House Administration, which oversees the internal operations of the House, he played an important role on policy issues ranging from election reform and campaign finance reform to enhancing the security of the Capitol complex in the aftermath of September 11.
Since 2009, Congressman Hoyer has led Team Maryland in its effort to bring the FBI's new consolidated headquarters to Prince George's County. In November 2023, the General Service Administration announced that it selected Greenbelt, Maryland, as the site for the state-of-the-art facility ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the culmination of Congressman Hoyer's 14 years of work on the project.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Now, Congressman Hoyer is working to get the project fully funded.

Biography
Richard E. Neal was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, and was raised and educated in the City of Springfield. He is a graduate of American International College, where he received his Bachelor's Degree in Political Science, and he received his MasterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Degree in Public Administration from the Barney School of Business and Public Administration at the University of Hartford.
Congressman Neal was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1988 and served his first two terms on the House Banking Committee before joining the Ways and Means Committee in 1993. In January 2019, Congressman Neal was elected by his colleagues to assume the esteemed position of Chairman, marking the first time since 1875 that a representative from Massachusetts had done so.
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Congressman Neal and the Ways and Means Committee worked tirelessly to bring relief to the American people.
The first relief bill, the CARES Act, included several provisions Ways and Means Committee Democrats secured including federal unemployment compensation, economic assistance payments, and telehealth flexibility. This bill singlehandedly saved the American economy.
In the American Rescue Plan Act, the Ways and Means Committe

e was responsible for nearly $1 trillion of the $1.9 trillion package. Under Chairman NealÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs leadership, the bill put more money directly into peopleÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs pockets, helping them better afford childcare and health coverage. It also shored up the hard-earned retirement security for millions of Americans nationwide.
In addition to the COVID-19 relief packages, Chairman Neal spearheaded a number of historic legislative achievements during the 116
th
and 117
th
Congress, including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, marking the largest long-term investment in our infrastructure and economy in our nation's history, and the Chips and Science Act, which will reinvigorate our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs domestic manufacturing of chips and incentivize research and development. Chairman Neal also helped address retirement security with his bipartisan bill ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂSECURE 2.0,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ which will increase participation in work-based retirement savings by expanding automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans and enhancing the start-up credit for small businesses to sponsor a retirement plan.
In addition, Chairman Neal led efforts to pass the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), much of which was written in the Ways and Means Committee. The IRA is a historic win for American families and the planet, with provisions that will lower costs while investing in AmericansÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ health and our future climate security. This includes lowering health care costs for millions of low and middle-income Americans by extending the Affordable Care ActÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs premium tax credit enhancements through 2025; allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and capping the out-of-pocket cost of medications for seniors, including capping the cost of insulin at $35/month; making the largest investment in our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs efforts to combat the climate crisis, generating 9 million g

Biography
Meet Jim McGovern
Congressman Jim McGovern represents the Second  District of Massachusetts in the United States House of Representatives. He is a champion for the people of his home state of Massachusetts, and a global leader working to end hunger, protect human rights, and promote peace. He believes public service should be about bringing us together and working to make life better for all our families.
Jim has been the top Democrat on the powerful House Rules Committee since 2018, serving as Chairman during the 116th and 117th Congress.
Jim has worked hard on the Rules Committee to
change business as usual
on Capitol Hill and make Congress work in a more open, transparent, bipartisan way. For example, he put in place rules to giveÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ all Members of Congress more time to read bills. He required that bills to go through the committee process instead of just being written behind closed doors, and he created a new office to recruit and retain congr

essional staff that reflect the diversity of the American people.
On the House Agriculture Committee, Jim has been a
global leader in the fight to end hunger.
He fought for and successfully secured a White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health to make ending hunger a national priority. Thanks to Jim's advocacy and tireless work, military families are being screened for hunger for the first time ever, families with children get enhanced food benefits, schools are able to provide more nutritious meals, and America now has a plan to end hunger within the decade.
Jim has spent his career in public service working to strengthen America's global leadership when it comes to protecting human rights and promoting peace. He serves on two commissions which monitor, investigate and advocate on behalf of international human rights, the rule of law, and good governance: the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, and the bipartisan Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. 
He has written and successfully passed into law several bills which help America identify and hold accountable corrupt foreign officials and human rights abusers. He has also authored and passed into law several pieces of legislation to hold the government of China accountable for human rights violations, including the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, the Tibet Policy and Support Act, and the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act
Jim's concern for human rights goes back to his time as a Congressional staffer, when he led an investigation into the murders of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter in El Salvador. Jim uncovered that the murders were committed by  Salvadoran soldiers who had been trained by the United States GovernmentÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂleading to a major shift in public opinion and a c

hange in U.S. policy that made future military aid contingent on improved human rights  in El Salvador.
Jim started learning about the importance of public service at a young age. As a 7
th
grader at Burncoat Elementary School (top row, right corner) he volunteered on the 1972 presidential campaign of  Senator George McGovern, a decorated war hero who became a champion for peace. Jim likes to say that while they're not related, he had a great last name. When Jim decided to attend college at the American University in Washington, D.C. he applied for an internship in the office of Senator McGovern.
Jim worked his way through college,  earning a BA in history and then spending over a decade working in the office of Congressman Joe Moakley, a Democrat from South Boston.  His time working for Moakley taught him that you have to stand up for what you believe in and work hard to give back to your community. After Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in 1995, Jim saw that Washington was working harder than ever for the rich and powerful while everyday people fell further and further behind. He successfully ran for Congress in 1996, and has won reelection every two years since then.
Jim takes principled stands on tough issues and works with Members of Congress from across the aisle and throughout the country to ensure that every single person in America and around the world is treated with dignity, decency, fairness, and respect.
Jim was born and raised in the Burncoat neighborhood of Worcester. The values he learned from his  family are the same ones he fights for every day in Congress: fairness, decency, respect for all people, and the idea that each of us has an obligation to give back to our community.

Biography
Congresswoman Lori Trahan proudly represents MassachusettsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Third Congressional District, made up of 35 cities and towns including her hometown of Lowell. The granddaughter of immigrants, Lori grew up in a working-class family with her dad working long, hard hours as a union ironworker and her mom juggling part-time jobs while caring for her and her three

 sisters.
Lori is a proud graduate of the Lowell Public School system, and during her time at Lowell High School, she became a standout volleyball player. She earned a volleyball scholarship to Georgetown University where she became the first person in her family to graduate from college. Like many, Lori was introduced to public service as a college student in Washington, D.C. After college, she joined former Congressman Marty MeehanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs staff, working her way up to Chief of Staff. She deeply enjoyed working to serve her hometown and people across Massachusetts, but she also witnessed firsthand the increasing partisanship that served wealthy special interests instead of families like the one she grew up in.
After a decade in public service, Lori took on a new challenge in the private sector as the only female executive at a tech company. Her passion for bringing women into leadership positions led her to co-found a women-owned and -operated consulting firm. In that role, she advised various companies on business strategy and how to create the ideal conditions for employees ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ especially women ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ to thrive.
Lori decided to run for Congress in 2018 ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the first time she had ever sought public office ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ because she wanted to expand economic opportunities for working families in Massachusetts. Sworn in alongside a historically diverse class of new members, Lori immediately got to work for the people of the Third District. Now, as a member of the powerful House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Lori is an advocate for Third District residents ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ working to expand access to affordable, quality health care, end the addiction crisis, rebuild our infrastructure, tackle climate change, protect kids online, and more. She also serves in House Democratic Leadership as Co-Chair of the Democ

During her time in Congress, Lori has responded swiftly to crises from the Merrimack Valley gas explosions, when she secured passage of the Leonel Rondon Pipeline Safety Act, to the COVID-19 pandemic, when she co-founded the Pandemic Preparedness Caucus, to the overturning of Roe v. Wade, when she immediately got to work on behalf of women and health care providers. With every issue, Lori continues to prioritize the district she was born in, raised in, and that she and her husband are now raising their two young daughters in. To that end, Lori has secured hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for local infrastructure projects, small businesses, health centers, community organizations, and more.
Lori and her husband, Dave,  are raising two young girls, Grace and Caroline, while keeping tabs on their three grown stepsons, Thomas, Dean, and Christian.

Congressman Stephen F. Lynch  
was first sworn in to the United States Congress in October 2001, following the passing of legendary Congressman John Joseph Moakley.  
The son of Francis Lynch, an ironworker, and Anne Lynch, a postal clerk, Congressman Lynch was born and raised in the public housing projects of South Boston.  
Upon graduation from South Boston High School in 1973, Congressman Lynch entered the Ironworkers Apprenticeship Program and later joined his father as a member of Boston's Ironworkers Local 7. He worked as a structural ironworker for 18 years and was eventually elected president of the Iron Workers Union, the youngest president in the history of the 2000 member union.  
Congressman Lynch continued h
is education at Wentworth Institute of Technology on nights and weekends, earning a Bachelor's degree in Construction Management. He later received a law degree from Boston College Law School, was admitted to both the Massachusetts and New Hampshire Bar, and continued his advocacy for working people as a labor and employment attorney.  
In 1994, Congressman Lynch was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. After just fourteen months in office, he was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate in a special election. In the Senate, he served as Chair of the Joint Committee on Commerce and Labor. In 1999, he earned a Master's Degree in Public Administration from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.  
During his career as an ironworker, Congressman Lynch worked at the General Motors Plant in Framingham, Massachusetts, the General Dynamics Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, and the U.S. Steel Plant in Gary, Indiana, all of which were either shut down or severely curtailed due to unfair foreign trade practices. Congressman Lynch's first-hand experience in seeing the effects of plant closings on American workers and local communities led him to focus on efforts to improve U.S. Trade Policy and protect American jobs.  
In the 119th Congress, Congressman Lynch is a member of the Financial Services Committee, where he serves as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence and is a member of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions.  
On the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Congressman Lynch is a member of the Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency and the Subcommittee on the Military and Foreign Affairs.

About Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib  
Biography  
Rashida Tlaib is an unbossed and unbought Congresswoman and, in her own words, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂa mother working for justice for all.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Her two young sons are at the root of her unwavering passion to help change lives for the better. She is the oldest of 14 children, born and raised in Detroit, the proud daughter of Palestinian immigrant parents.  
Rashida made history in 2008 by becoming the first Muslim woman to ever serve in the Michigan Legislature. She is beloved by residents for the transformative constituent services she provides, and for successfully fighting the billionaires and corporations that pollute her district. When families get to know Rashida, they have no doubt that she will work tirelessly to knock down barriers for real change, and whether by policy or action, she will roll up her sleeves to make sure her residents are cared for, no matter how big the challenge.  
When billionaire slumlord Matty Moroun refused to follow the law and get polluting semi-trucks off neighborhood streets, Rashida organized residents with the  
We Have A Right To Breathe  
campaign and forced Moroun to fulfill his obligations to protecting public health. When large piles of black dust started showing up on the Detroit riverfront and blowing into homes and parks, and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality told residents everything was fine, Rashida collected samples and got the substance tested herself ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ exposing the cancer-causing ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂpetroleum cokeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ as a threat, and getting it removed.

ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Rashida knows that effective advocacy requires an all-out approach, fighting in the community, in the legislature, and in the courts every day against injustice and inequality, so that every single person in this country has a chance to thrive.

County including the city of Detroit, Grosse Pointe, and Downriver. Congressman Thanedar is passionate about fighting to improve the lives of hard working families in metro-Detroit.
Prior to being elected to Congress in 2022, Congressman Thanedar served in the Michigan House of Representatives. At the State Capitol he helped pass the largest increase in per-pupil funding for Michigan Public Schools in state history. Congressman Thanedar knows first hand how important education can be for a young person, just as it was for him.
B
orn into a large family in Southern India, Congressman Thanedar knows firsthand the struggles and stigma of poverty. At times his family home lacked running water and electricity and he was sometimes unsure of where his next meal would come from. But, in 1979, after completing his undergraduate and Masters Degrees in Chemistry, Congressman Thanedar came to America in order to complete his PHD in Chemistry at the University of Akron, which he earned in 1982. He later became a US Citizen in 1988. While in school, Congressman Thanedar worked as a janitor to make ends meet and at times slept in his car.
After completing his education, Congressman Thanedar worked as a researcher and eventually an entrepreneur where he built successful companies. His companies employed hundreds of people and helped in the development of life-saving pharmaceutical drugs. In recognition of his success, Congressman Thanedar was named Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year in 1997, 2007, and 2016. In 2016, when Congressman Thanedar sold his business, he shared $1.5 million from the sale with his 50 employees with amounts based on their tenure ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a company secretary who was the longest serving employee received the largest bonus.

iness leader and scientist, he took up the calling of public service. In 2018 he ran for Governor of Michigan. While not victorious, Congressman Thanedar advocated for working families by bringing forward critical issues like universal health care, raising the minimum wage, and improving MichiganÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs crumbling infrastructure. In 2020, he ran successfully for the Michigan Legislature. There he served on the powerful appropriations committee and helped bring millions of dollars back to his Detroit based district.
Congressman Thanedar will never forget what it's like to live in poverty, and he will never stop working to lift Michigan families out of it. ThatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs why heÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs committed to fighting for more education and job training resources for southeast Michigan, a higher minimum wage, universal health care, and programs to jumpstart entrepreneurship in historically disenfranchised communities. Together, these initiatives will close the racial wealth gap and help more families in southeast Michigan thrive.
Congressman Thanedar lives in DetroitÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Palmer Woods neighborhood with his wife Shashi. He is a proud father and grandfather.

Biography
Growing up in the Midwest, Jack BergmanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs parents instilled in him the values that drive the American Dream: If you work hard, never quit, and strive for excellence, you will find success. Those values are what guided him to the rank of Lt. General in the United States Marine Corps, empowered him to successfully own and operate a small business, and allowed him to enjoy a 22-year career as a commercial airline pilot.
Jack proudly represents the First District of Michigan. The boundaries contain the entire Upper Peninsula and all of northern lower Peninsula. Altogether, the district makes up about 44% of the land mass of the state of Michigan. The Bergman family roots in MichiganÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Upper Peninsula stretch back to the late 1800ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs where his ancestors worked as iron miners. Serving his country in uniform for 40 years, Jack has spent time all around the United States ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and world. Nearly three decades ago, Jack and his wife Cindy settled in Watersmeet, on the western edge of MichiganÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs beautiful Upper Peninsula.

ildren. This has always been one of the largest factors in his service in Congress. When Jack sees what is happening in Washington, he knows that we are not doing our best at leaving our children and grandchildren a better place. From his business to his distinguished military career, and now in Congress - Jack Bergman does not accept the status-quo as an acceptable path forward. Jack is driven by his commitment to serving others. While in the military, he launched two successful startup businesses in the medical equipment field, maintaining an obligation to both his nation and his customers simultaneously. As an entrepreneurial leader focused on mission accomplishment and customer satisfaction, Jack knows how to get things done.  
Hard work and commitment made the United States the most exceptional nation in the world. Those are the principles that have guided JackÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs life, and are the principles that he is bringing to Washington. He believes what most Michiganders believe: Americans know how to live their lives better than politicians or bureaucrats do. JackÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs life has been dedicated to service and defending the Constitution. He is the highest ranking combat Veteran to have ever served in the U.S. House. He is shaking up the status quo in both Congress and will continue defending the United States from those who want to weaken it, both domestically and abroad.

Congresswoman Hillary J. Scholten is honored to serve the people of MichiganÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Third Congressional District, a diverse district that is anchored by the urban centers of Grand Rapids, Muskegon, and Grand Haven, and includes suburbs, farmland, and miles of beautiful Lake Michigan shoreline.
Congresswoman Scholten is a fourth-generation West Michigander, a mom, a Christian, and an attorney who proudly served in the U.S. Department of Justice. Her great-great-grandparents emigrated to the United States to find opportunity in West Michigan. Ever since, her parents, grandparents, and extended family have put down deep roots in this communityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂcommitted not only to building a better life for themselves and their families, but devoted to creating a better community for all.
A foundation of faith has motivated Congresswoman ScholtenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs career in public service and her desire to continue to serve West Michigan in Congress. Inspired by her mother, a dedicated community servant
---
who spent most of her career as a public school teacher at a high-poverty elementary school, Congresswoman Scholten began her own career as a social worker. She worked with people affected by issues of housing and homelessness. During this time, she worked with individuals in the LGBTQ community who were facing homelessness and housing insecurityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂoften because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. In the early part of her career, she gained insight and expertise into how systems work and far too often donÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt for those on the margins in society.  
Congresswoman Scholten obtained her law degree from the University of Maryland Thurgood Marshall School of Law, and then went on to clerk for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in their special unit focused on immigration issues. Following her clerkship, she joined the Justice Department through the Attorney General Honors Program, where she continued to work on matters of immigration and civil rights.  
Congresswoman Scholten now serves as the first woman and mother ever to represent MichiganÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Third District in Congress. Bringing new voices to the table is key to making sure our representation is equitable and reflective of the district. SheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs building one of the most diverse teams to ever serve West Michigan, both in Washington, D.C., and at home in the district. Service is at the heart of what drives Congresswoman ScholtenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs mission to deliver for the district every single day. SheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs focused on providing responsive, effective, down-to-earth, accessible representation that meets the practical needs of the district. This includes securing critical infrastructure investments and eliminating transportation barriers in isolated communities, supporting our small business community, improving K-12 education and
---
 higher education, and fighting for West MichigandersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ fundamental rights at the federal level.
West Michigan is Congresswoman ScholtenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs home. She and her husband, Jesse, are raising their two boys and the family dog, Smoky, on the southeast side of Grand Rapids. YouÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂll often find her on the sidelines at her kidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ sporting events, walking Smoky, or in line at the grocery store. At the end of the day, Representative Scholten is committed to rolling up her sleeves and getting to work on the issues that matter to working families across the district, because they matter to her and her family, tooÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs what representation is all about.

Biography  
Congressman Bill Huizenga (HIGH-zen-guh) represents Michigan's 4th Congressional District. This district stretches along the shores of Lake Michigan to Battle Creek to include all of Allegan and Van Buren Counties as well as portions of Berrien, Calhoun, Kalamazoo, and Ottawa Counties. Michigan's 4th Congressional District is home to beautiful beaches, a diverse array of agriculture, and a strong manufacturing base.  
Congressman Huizenga is an original member of the Bipartisan Fiscal Forum (BFF), a group founded during the 118th Congress that is dedicated to sounding the alarm about our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs unsustainable debt trajectory and working together to get control of our fiscal future. Huizenga serves as the Republican Co-Chair, working with the groupÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs members to elevate the debt issue while providing Members with opportunities to improve the fiscal policy debate in Congress. The group began informally in 2020 and has since engaged in bipartisan collaboration to put forward ideas that address our growing debt and exploding interest costs. This included the introduction of the Fiscal Commissio

n Act of 2023 to create a bipartisan, bicameral fiscal commission to propose recommendations on significantly improving our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs medium and long-term fiscal trajectory.
Since 2017, Congressman Huizenga has been elected by his colleagues to serve as a Co-Chair of the Great Lakes Task Force. This bipartisan group fosters cooperation and support for policies and programs that enhance the environmental health of the Great Lakes while also ensuring the full economic potential of the Great Lakes region is realized. As a bipartisan leader on the Great Lakes, Huizenga has successfully rallied bipartisan support for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI), a program that is vital to preserving and protecting the Great Lakes ecology while also promoting opportunities for the Great Lakes economy.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  The GLRI has had multiple success stories across Michigan and throughout the Great Lakes basin.
Congressman Huizenga is also a founding member of the bipartisan PFAS Task Force. The goals of the Task Force include educating members of Congress and the public about the potential impacts of PFAS, crafting bipartisan legislation to help communities recover from PFAS contamination, and working to determine the proper health and safety levels of PFAS. Bill believes residents in Southwest Michigan and across the nation deserve to know the truth and the full picture about the health risks as well as the sources of PFAS and PFOAS.
In the 119th Congress, Huizenga will also lead the following bipartisan caucuses and groups: the US-Canada Interparliamentary Group, the Northern Border Caucus, the Congressional Burma Caucus, and the Congressional Study Group on Europe.
During the 119th Congress, Congressman Huizenga will serve as the Vice Chair of the House Financial Services Committee. As

Congresswoman Debbie Dingell represents MichiganÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 6
th
Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives. She is a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Natural Resources Committee, where she leads on critical issues including affordable and accessible health care, clean energy and water, domestic manufacturing and supply chain resilience, and protecting our wildlife and natural resources. Growing up in beautiful Michigan, Dingell, who chairs the Great Lakes Task Force, has always been an advocate for the outdoors and commits her work in Congress to protecting the environment for generations. Dingell is focused on bringing people together ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ in Congress and in her communities ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ to support MichiganÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs families and the economy. This is most evident in her work to strengthen the American auto industry, maintaining AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs c

ompetitiveness and ensuring good-paying American jobs. In 2021, she worked together with the White House, the auto industry, the auto workers, and environmentalists to announce the Biden AdministrationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs goal of having 50% of new vehicles sold in 2030 be zero-emissions vehicles. Dingell also plays a major role in leading the fight against PFAS contamination, spearheading the
PFAS Action Act
with Republican colleague Rep. Fred Upton. Her collaborative workstyle also lends itself to bicameral work, most importantly on long-term care, as she authored the
Better Care Better Jobs Act
with Senator Bob Casey to strengthen and expand access to the long-term care system while also supporting the direct care workforce. As a fierce advocate for reform to our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs broken health care system, she is also the co-author of Medicare For All to finally guarantee care for all Americans.
Back home in Michigan, Dingell is known for working closely with state and local officials and community leaders to support hardworking families and address critical issues across MichiganÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 6th District. In 2021, her Honoring Abbas Family Legacy to Terminate (HALT) Drunk Driving Act, a bill she wrote after the Abbas family of Northville was killed by a drunk driver and which would require drunk driving prevention technology to be installed in new cars, was enacted into law. Dingell also worked quickly to secure federal flood relief funding and support to her communities amidst the 2021 summer floods that devastated thousands of Southeast Michigan families and businesses. Additionally, Dingell continued her husband JohnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs work to open the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge and create a special outdoor space for Michiganders, while also protecting natural resources.

, Dingell meets with VFW posts and visits VA hospitals in the district and even improved the Strategic Analytics for Improvement and Learning (SAIL) rating in the Ann Arbor VA hospital.
Before being elected to Congress, Dingell ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a self-proclaimed car girl ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ worked in the auto industry for over three decades, where she was President of the General Motors (GM) Foundation and a senior executive responsible for public affairs. She was also Chairman of the Wayne State University (WSU) Board of Governors and to this day continues to fight for affordable and accessible education in Congress. She chaired the Michigan Infant Mortality Task Force, the ChildrenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Leadership Council of Michigan, the Early Childhood Investment Corporation, the Baby Your Baby public education campaign that reduced infant mortality rates in Michigan, and has served on the board of MichiganÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Children, a statewide independent voice advocating for public policies in the best interest of children of all ages.
An active civic and community leader, Dingell is a recognized national advocate for women and children. She successfully fought to have women included in federally funded health research and advocated for greater awareness of womenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs health issues overall, including breast cancer and heart health. She is a founder and former chair of the National WomenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Health Resource Center and the Children's Inn at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Debbie is a respected voice in Michigan and has been named multiple times on CrainÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Detroit BusinessÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 100 Most Influential Women in Michigan list.

Representative Tom Barrett represents MichiganÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 7th Congressional District. A lifelong Michigan resident, Tom grew up in a hardworking family where his father worked two jobs and his mother stayed home to raise Tom and his six siblings. From an early age, he learned the importance of hard work, perseverance, and the value of family.
After high school, Tom joined the United States Army, where he served for 22 years in multiple key locations around the world, including Iraq, Guantanamo Bay, Kuwait, and the Korean DMZ. Throughout his military career, he logged over 1,000 hours flying advanced helicopters, earning numerous awards and distinctions along the way.
After retiring from the military, Tom returned to Michigan, where he was shocked to discover that veterans were facing significant challenges finding employment. With Michigan holding one of the highest veteran unemployment rates in the nation, Tom knew he had to take action.

Kristen McDonald Rivet is a lifelong Michigander who has spent her career fighting for working families and finding common sense solutions that make communities safer, families stronger and life just a little bit more affordable. She now proudly represents MichiganÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 8th District ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ including Genesee, Saginaw, Bay, and Midland countiesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ in the U.S. Congress.
Kristen was raised in a small, farm town in Michigan. Her mom stayed home to raise her and her sisters while her dad worked construction often clocking 80 hours a week to make ends meet. Thanks to their sacrifice, Kristen and her sisters were the first generation in the family to go to college.
In Congress, Kristen is laser focused on commonsense solutions that level the playing field for working families and puts more money into their pockets. Her top priorities include cutting taxes for the working and middle class, lowering the cost of groceries, housing, prescription drugs, and childcare, and bringing good-paying jobs to mid-Michigan. She believes we must protect hard-earned benefits, like Social Security and Medicare. And Kristen works with both parties to make sure MichiganÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs law enforcement has the necessary resources to keep our communities safe.
Kristen was elected by her peers to serve as the Freshman

Leadership Representative to the New Democratic Coalition. The ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂNew DemsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ are a group of more than 100 middle-of-the-road Democrats in the 119th Congress, committed to working with members of both parties to deliver common sense solutions. With this leadership position, Congresswoman McDonald Rivet will be able to elevate issues important to Michigan families ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ like lowering costs, creating good-paying jobs, and keeping mid-Michiganders safe.
Before being elected to Congress, Kristen served in the Michigan State Senate. Most notably, she led the effort to pass the largest tax cut for working families in state history, and helped repeal MichiganÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs burdensome retirement tax. After the Dobbs decision, Kristen helped repeal MichiganÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs extreme abortion ban and enshrine the right to abortion into MichiganÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs constitution.
Prior to serving in elected office, Kristen spent decades advocating for more affordable childcare and better education for every kid in Michigan, including as Executive Director of Michigan Head Start, Chief of Staff the Michigan Department of Education, and Vice President of The Skillman Foundation.
Kristen currently lives in Bay City with her husband Joseph, youngest son Elijah and their cat Tuck. They have five other adult children ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Courtney, Grant, Laken, Madison, and Ella.

Kelly served for six years in the Minnesota legislature, and developed a track record of working across the aisle to get things done. She passed over 90 bills during her time in the state House and Senate, more than almost every other legislator. She led the fight to protect a womanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs right to make her own health care decisions and took on the big pharmaceutical companies and passed legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs.  
And as a mom, Kelly is focused on keeping our kids safe and healthy and has championed efforts to combat gun violence, take on the opioid crisis, strengthen mental health support in schools, fight climate change, and protect our lakes and rivers.  
Kelly puts her constituents and their priorities first. She has fought for leg

Congressman Bennie G. ThompsonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Biography:
Congressman Bennie G. Thompson is an elected member of the United States House of Representatives from MississippiÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 2nd Congressional District. He claimed his seat in the House on April 20, 1993. A proud native of Bolton, Mississippi, Congressman Thompson considers it an honor to serve his constituents and advocate for civil rights, education, health, infrastructure, and property rights.
Now serving his 16th term in the United States House of Representatives, Congressman Thompson has spent his entire career fighting to improve the lives of all people. He is the longest
---
-serving African American elected official in the State of Mississippi and the lone Democrat in the Mississippi Congressional Delegation.  
Congressman ThompsonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs commitment to public service was inspired by his early involvement in the civil rights movement. He began his grassroots political activism by joining civil rights leader Fannie Lou Hamer in her 1965 bid for Congress. This experience ignited his passion for deeper involvement as he witnessed systemic oppression in Mississippi. During his early years, he worked with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) as an undergraduate at Tougaloo College and served as a field organizer for Fannie Lou HamerÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Congressional campaign, hosting voter registration drives for African Americans in Mississippi.  
Building on this early activism, his dedication to civil service led him to run his own campaigns. He served as Alderman (1969-1972) and Mayor (1973-1980) of Bolton, MS, and as a county supervisor (1980-1993) in Hinds County, Mississippi. Ultimately, this journey led to his bid for CongressÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe very seat for which Fannie Lou Hamer once campaigned.  
Congressman Bennie G. Thompson has been married to his college sweetheart, London Johnson of Mound Bayou, Mississippi, for 54 years. Together, they have one daughter, one granddaughter, and one grandson. Thompson is a lifetime member of the Asbury United Methodist Church in Bolton, Mississippi. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Tougaloo College in Political Science where he was inducted as member of the Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. (Gamma Rho 1967ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Tougaloo College). Thompson also holds a Master of Science degree in Educational Administration from Jackson State University.  
Carrying forward his deep connection to education, Congressman Thompson has been a lif
---
elong advocate for students attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Through his support of the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF), Mississippi received nearly $575 million for higher education, including over $237 million for seven HBCUs. This funding provided critical support for student financial relief, retaining faculty and staff, and maintaining campus operations during the pandemic, reflecting Congressman ThompsonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs commitment to ensuring every student has access to opportunity and success.
Expanding his leadership to the field of healthcare, in 2000, Congressman Thompson played a key role as a lead author and sponsor of legislation that established the National Center for Minority Health and Health Care Disparities. He recognized the significant healthcare gaps faced by underserved communities, particularly in the Mississippi Delta, and worked to ensure that resources were allocated to address these disparities. His ongoing commitment to healthcare equity has driven him to advocate for policies that improve access to quality care, especially for minority populations.
While his early work as Mayor of Bolton focused on local infrastructure, Congressman Thompson has maintained that focus throughout his career. As Mayor, he spearheaded the paving of roads, the repair of water and sewer systems, and the renovation of deteriorating homes, laying a foundation for community growth. As a member of Congress, he prioritized infrastructure by supporting federal investments to improve roads, bridges, and utilities in MississippiÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 2nd District, which has historically faced significant infrastructure challenges.
In addition to infrastructure, Congressman Thompson has taken on complex issues like property ownership in underserved communities.
---
---
He played a crucial role in the ""Heirs Property"" case, advocating for policies to address the inequities caused by the practice of heirs' property, where property ownership is passed down through generations without clear titles. This issue disproportionately affected Black families in Mississippi and other Southern states, leading to the loss of land and resources. Thompson's efforts aimed to secure legislative measures to resolve this issue, protecting the rights of families to retain and benefit from their ancestral land.
Congressman ThompsonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs leadership has also extended to national security. Before becoming the top Democratic member of the Homeland Security Committee in 2005, Congressman Thompson served on the Agriculture, Budget, and Small Business Committees. His colleagues promoted him to be the first-ever Democratic Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee.
More recently, on July 1, 2021, Speaker Nancy Pelosi named Rep. Thompson Chairman of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. Under Chairman ThompsonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs leadership, the bipartisan committee conducted a thorough investigation of the facts, circumstances, and causes of the January 6th attack and worked to ensure nothing like that attack ever occurs again. The Select Committee presented its findings about a multi-part effort to overturn the 2020 election, reflecting the body of evidence the committee amassed from more than 1,000 interviews and hundreds of thousands of records.
Congressman ThompsonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs impactful work has earned him national recognition. He received the ChairmanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Award during the 2023 NAACP Image Award, which recognizes Thompson's advocacy for civil rights. Most recently, he received the 2025 Presidential Citizens Medal presented by President Jos
---
eph R. Biden, which is awarded to citizens of the United States who have performed admirable deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens.
Through his decades of service, Congressman ThompsonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs work in Congress has consistently sought to address his district's systemic challenges, championing education, healthcare, infrastructure, and civil rights. His leadership has left an indelible mark on Mississippi and the broader fight for justice and equity.

Anthony Pro-Life America and the Family Research Council for his pro-life stance, the National Rifle Association for his strong defense of our Second Amendment rights, and the National Federation of Independent Businesses for his support of pro-growth policies.

Congressman Guest is committed to securing our country's southwest border to help curb the flow of illegal drugs into our communities.
Congressman Guest joins a distinguished list of Mississippians who have served Mississippi on the Appropriations Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives.

CONGRESSWOMAN ANN WAGNER ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ MISSOURI'S 2ND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT
Ann Wagner's career is both deep and broad in service to her hometown, state and nation with over 30 years of work in the private sector, community and public service, and the political arena.
The 2nd District has always been home for Ann. It is where she and her husband of over thirty years, Ray, grew up, went to school, raised their children, work, volunteer, and go to church. This community has given her extraordinary opportunities to make a difference.
At an early age, Ann started working in the family business, a retail carpet store called Carpetime in Manchester. Working beside her parents she learned the value of a dollar, a strong work

ethic, honesty, integrity, and that government should stay off the backs and out of the way of hard-working Americans trying to make a living.
Ann then took that experience to the University of Missouri-Columbia and received her Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with an emphasis in Logistics. After college, Ann went to work in the private sector and held management positions at Hallmark Cards in Kansas City and Ralston Purina in St. Louis.
Ann's most important jobs, however, have always been as a wife, mother, and now grandmother. Ann and Ray have three children: Raymond, an Army Captain who recently welcomed his first child, Isabella, into the world with his wife Julia; Stephen, a Client Services Manager for a St. Louis area financial management company; and Mary Ruth, a recent college graduate who moved back to the 2nd District and is working as a Business Development Coordinator.
Ann Wagner's public service began at the grassroots level. She served for nine years as a local committeewoman in Lafayette Township and went on to Chair the Missouri Republican Party, delivering historic Republican gains. She also served as Co-Chairman of the Republican National Committee during the first term of President George W. Bush.
In 2005, following nomination by President Bush and confirmation by the U.S. Senate, Ann was sworn in as the 19th U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. She served as U.S. Ambassador for four years before returning to her home in Ballwin, Missouri.
Ann then decided to put her own name on the ballot and won her first Congressional race with over 60% of the vote, receiving more votes that election cycle than any other Republican Congressional candidate in Missouri. She took office in January of 2013 and was selecte

d by both her freshman and sophomore class to be their representative on the Elected Leadership Committee.
As your representative from the 2nd District, Congresswoman Wagner serves on both the House Financial Services Committee and House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. She has worked tirelessly to demand transparency and accountability from federal regulators, while continuing to investigate waste, fraud, and abuse. During her time in Congress, Representative Wagner has been committed to regulatory reform, authoring bills such as the Retail Investor Protection Act which protects access to retirement savings for middle class families.
Ann has made combating sex trafficking and online exploitation of women and children major legislative priorities. She authored the SAVE Act, which amended the Federal criminal code to allow prosecutions of those who knowingly advertise sex slavery, along with the Put Trafficking Victims First Act and the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA). FOSTA became law in April of 2018 and is the most significant anti-trafficking law Congress has passed in nearly 20 years, finally giving local, state, and federal prosecutors the tools they need to hold websites accountable when they profit from the sale of sex trafficking victims.

Congressman
Mark Alford
Mark Alford is a husband, father, former small business owner and former TV news anchor, and proudly represents MissouriÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 4th District in Congress. Alford spent 25 years anchoring Kansas CityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs #1 morning news show prior to his time in Congress.
His time covering MissouriÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs top news stories connected him to thousands of Missourian families of all walks of life, providing insight into the issues most important to Missouri families, and the struggles most common to them. It also offered the opportunity to hone his God-given talents as a professional communicator, enhancing his voice to inform, influence, and inspire millions of people across Missouri.
AlfordÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs experience behind the news desk gave him a front row view to the constant attacks against our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs founding principles from an increasingly liberal, progressive ideology that threatens to undermine our countryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs values of faith, family, h

AlfordÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs serves as a megaphone to each and every Missourian in the 4th district, magnifying their voices and their values in Washington, D.C.
Over the years, AlfordÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs voice helped raise millions of dollars for charities both locally and nationally, and served dozens of boards, foundations, churches, civic organizations, families, and strangers. Alford and his wife Leslie have been married 33 years and share three grown children.
After being sworn into the 118thÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Congress as a freshman member, Alford was selected to the House Armed Services Committee, House Agriculture committee, and House Small Business committee.

The committee has broad jurisdiction over some of the most consequential issues facing Missourians today, including all federal tax policy, all U.S. trade and tariffs, Social Security, Medicare, and many welfare programs.
As Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, SmithÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs top priority is delivering for the working families, farmers, and small businesses that make the American economy the envy of the world. ThatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs why, under SmithÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs leadership, the committee is traveling outside the marble halls of Congress to hold its hearings so that Americans who canÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt afford to make the trip to the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs capital have the opportunity to shape the policies that impact their lives every single day.

Ryan Zinke is a fifth generation Montanan who serves as Representative for MontanaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs First Congressional District covering 16 counties in western Montana including the cities of Bozeman, Butte, Missoula, Kalispell. First elected to Congress in 2014, and serving as U.S. Secretary of the Interior between noncontiguous terms, Zinke has built a track record of accomplishments in energy, conservation, tribal and military issues. Now in his third term, Zinke is a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, focusing his legislative agenda on restoring accountability to federal spending, restoring American energy dominance, and bolstering national security at our borders and beyond.
Ryan began public service in 1985 when he joined the U.S. Navy and graduated from Officer Candidate School. He was recruited to join the U.S. Navy SEALs where he went on dozens of deployments targeting terrorist cells in Asia, war criminals in Bosnia, and combatting the rise of radical Islamic terrorists in the middle east. During his military career he held a number of leadership positions including as Ground Forces and Task Force commander at SEAL Teams SIX oversaw the U.S. Navy SEAL BUD/S training after 9/11, and was Deputy/Acting Commander of Joint Special Forces d

uring the Iraq war. In 2006 he was awarded the Bronze Star for his service. Commander Zinke retired from active duty in 2008 after serving for 23 years.
Following his military service, Ryan was elected to the Montana State Senate and was twice elected as MontanaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs sole member of the U.S. House of Representatives. During his first two terms as Congressman, Zinke served on the House Armed Services Committee and Natural Resources Committee. As a leading member of the Natural Resources Committee, Ryan challenged the Obama Administration on their policies that locked Montanans out of public lands and introduced legislation to strengthen public access and conservation.
In December 2016, Congressman Zinke was nominated to be the United States Secretary of the Interior by President Donald J. Trump and later confirmed by a bipartisan vote in the Senate.
Ryan is a fifth generation Montanan who was born in Bozeman and lives on the same property in Whitefish his family has called home since the 1950s. In high school, Ryan served as class president and was a multiple sport, All-State athlete who earned a place in the Whitefish High School Football Hall of Fame. He received an athletic scholarship to the University of Oregon where he lettered all four years and graduated with a B.S. in Geology. He also holds a Masters in Business Finance from National University and a Masters in Global Leadership from the University of San Diego.
Ryan is married to the former Lolita Hand and together they have three children: two sons, Wolfgang and Konrad, a daughter Jennifer. Ryan and Lola are grandparents to two granddaughters.

" Troy, Downing",Troy_Downing,2nd,Montana,R,https://downing.house.gov/,https://downing.house.gov/about,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Downing,New York University,,,,,"Republican Congressman Troy Downing is currently serving his first term as the United States Representative for MontanaÂs Second Congressional District. 

A proud Montanan, Congressman Downing began his career as an educator, spending time at New York UniversityÂs Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences as a research scientist and teacher in NYUÂs IT department before leaving higher education to found a technology startup company that would later merge with Yahoo! Inc. Following this successful venture, DowningÂs passion for entrepreneurship saw him helping other startups through mentorship and angel financing. 

When America faced its darkest hour following the terror attacks of September 11th, 2001, Congressman Downing rushed to enlist. He joined the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard, ultimately serving eight years with a Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) squadron including two tours of duty to Afghanistan. While there, Downing ventured beyond the wire numerous times to rescue wounded soldiers on the battlefield. If he wasnÂt forward deployed or on alert, Congressman Downing could be found volunteering in the U.S. military hospital in Kandahar or on outreach missions in-country. The CSAR motto, Âthese things we do, that others may live,Â guided Congressman Downing in combat. He brings the same service-first mentality to the halls of Congress and is still actively engaged with multiple Montana-based veteransÂ organizations. 

Following his military service, Congressman Downing would return to the private sector where he founded, among various other ventures and small businesses, a nationwide insurance company in addition to a commercial real estate firm.  

Most recently, Congressman Downing served as Montana State Auditor where he was tasked with oversight of MontanaÂs insurance and securities industries. Downing leveraged his experience in the private sector to engage with complex insurance and securities regulation, working to defend state residents from fraud, lower costs for families, and promote economic development. Under Congressman DowningÂs leadership, industry thrived, rates stayed low, and consumers were protected, all to the benefit of everyday Montanans. 

As one of five statewide elected posts, the Montana State Auditor serves an additional role as a member of the Board of Land Commissioners, a responsibility that saw Congressman Downing work to increase access to public lands and promote natural resources development. Guided by the principles of multiple use and sustained yield, Downing voted to approve timber sales, oil and gas leases, and agricultural projects in an effort to do right by MontanaÂs farmers, grow the stateÂs economy, and unleash American energy. 

Congressman Downing is one of the newest members of the House Financial Services Committee and House Committee on Small Business. DowningÂs extensive business and regulatory experience will prove invaluable as he looks to help House Republicans expand access to capital for rural small businesses, create clear rules of the road for digital assets, support and strengthen Montana community banks, bring back American energy dominance, secure the border, and hold China accountable. 

He resides in Helena, Montana with his wife, Heather. They have four grown children.",0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0

Biography
Meet Don
Growing up and working on the family farm in Illinois, Rep. Don Bacon learned first-hand how the value of hard work and commitment contributes to the success of a small business. He left the farm to attend Northern Illinois University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science in 1984. That same year, he married Angie, the love of his life. Together they share three sons, one daughter, and eight grandchildren.
In 1985, Don began his military career when he joined the U. S. Air Force and served nearly thirty years on active duty, culminating his military career at the rank of Brigadier General. During his career in the Air Force, Don specialized in electronic warfare and intelligence.
His military career highlights include two tours as a Wing Commander, at Ramstein Airbase in Germany and Offutt Air Force Base in Bellevue, Nebraska; squ

adron and group command at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona; and expeditionary squadron command, flying combat missions over Iraq. Don served 16 assignments with four deployments to the Middle East, including one to Iraq from 2007 to 2008 during Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. Don is a National War College graduate, Distinguished Graduate of Intelligence School, Navigator School, and Air Command and Staff College. He earned two master's degrees while serving in the Air Force.
In 2016, Don was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Nebraska's Second Congressional District. He was named to the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) in 2017, where he currently serves on the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces and the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. In the 118th Congress, Don was named chairman of the bi-partisan HASC Military Quality-of-Life Panel and led a year-long inquiry into military pay, housing, childcare, support for military spouses, and healthcare access. His efforts yielded more than thirty legislative recommendations to improve the lives of military servicemembers and families, which were included in the House National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2025.
After completing his work on the Military Quality of Life Panel, Don was named chairman of the HASC Subcommittee on Cyber, Information Technologies, and Innovation. Since 2017, he has been named by the Speaker of the House to every NDAA Conference Committee responsible for reconciling differences between the House and the Senate defense bills before final passage and enactment.
Serving on the House Committee on Agriculture since 2017, he led the effort on the 2017 Farm Bill to include language for a Foot-and-Mouth Disease vaccine and has four bills included in th

e House's version of the 2024 Farm Bill: a bill to monitor and prohibit foreign ownership of farmland; language allowing temporary contractor hiring for efficient SNAP administration during crises, funding for youth organizations, expanding programs in rural areas to nurture leadership and community engagement; and language to protect roosters and dogs, prohibit trafficking, enabling citizen suits, and enhance enforcement.
During his tenure in Congress, Don co-founded and twice chaired the For Country Caucus, a group of principled military veteran congressional members working together across party lines to pass thoughtful legislation related to national security, veterans' affairs, and national service issues. In addition, he served as Chair of the Republican Main Street Caucus, a group he resurrected in the 117th Congress. He is currently a co-chair for the largest bipartisan caucus, the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth. A member of the Air Force Academy Board of Visitors since 2017, Boards for the Holocaust Museum, Don also co-chairs the House Baltic Caucus, the Congressional Office for International Leadership, the Electromagnetic Warfare Working Group, and the Congressional Soccer Caucus.
Following the 2019 Midwest floods, which devasted Offutt Air Force Base and Camp Ashland, Don quickly organized the effort in the House to secure more than $1.6 billion in emergency federal funding to clean up, rebuild, and modernize both installations, which are critical to our national defense and Nebraska's economy. Following his support for the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Eppley Airfield has received more than $70 million to modernize this significant regional transportation hub, making it more accessible for international flights. Most recently, thi

About
A Gering native whose family has called Nebraska home for six generations, Congressman Adrian Smith was first introduced to politics by his grandfather. Adrian's first encounter with government regulations was when he was a child running a snow cone stand, and he realized at a young age what overly restrictive government policies can do to American businesses.
Prior to his election to Congress in 2006, Adrian worked as an educator, real estate agent, and served his hometown as a member of the city council. He then represented District 48 for eight years in the Unicameral.
In his work on Capitol Hill he has demonstrated steady leadership, a commitment to hard work, and dedication to Nebraska commonsense. Adrian has tackled issues ranging from international market access for Nebraska goods to advocating for rural America and opportunities to help feed the world.
Since 2010, he has served on the powerful Ways and Means Committee. Adrian ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ who is Chairman of Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ actively promotes market access for Nebras

ka products in Asia, South America, Europe, and throughout the world. His leadership on trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, continues to open new opportunities for agriculture producers and manufacturers to keep Nebraska's economy strong. He also fought for and delivered tax relief for Nebraska families, ag producers, and small business owners by helping craft the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the first tax code overhaul to be signed into law in a generation.
In addition to his work on trade and tax issues, Adrian is also as a member of the Subcommittee on Health where he is a champion for lowering drug costs, strengthening American innovation, expanding access to telehealth, and giving every American more control over their health care no matter where they live. He also serves a member of the House Democracy Partnership.
A staunch conservative, Adrian has consistently voted against tax increases and government bailouts. He continues to fight for policies to secure the border, defend Nebraskans' Constitutional freedoms, address inflation and our supply chain crisis, unleash domestic energy sources, and promote a strong economy to provide certainty for American families and job creators. He is pro-life.
He and his wife, Andrea, reside in Gering, Nebraska, with their two young children.

About Dina Titus  
Serving the First Congressional District of Nevada for more than a decade, Rep. Dina Titus is the dean of NevadaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs delegation.  Previously she served as State Senate Minority Leader from 1993 to 2009.  
Dina has been a persistent champion for average Nevadans and has been rated one of the most effective Democratic members of the House of Representatives by the Center for Effective Lawmaking.  
Dina is addressing the affordable housing crisis in Southern Nevada with legislation to provide more rental housing vouchers for lower-income families. She also is pushing legislation to help homebuyers by forcing outside institutional investors to divest themselves of the thousands of homes they have bought in Southern Nevada. Dina wants those homes to be owned by people

, not corporations. She has brought jobs to Southern Nevada as a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. She has introduced legislation to raise the minimum wage and she has fought to protect a womanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs right to choose.

Dina played an integral role in making the Brightline West High-Speed Rail Project possible. The train which will connect Southern California to Southern Nevada is anticipated to generate over $10 billion in economic activity and create more than 35,000 good-paying construction jobs.
After helping the Las Vegas community recover from the deadliest shooting in modern American history, Dina has emerged as one of the leading voices in Congress for substantive action to reduce gun violence. She introduced legislation to ban bump stocks that convert rifles into machine guns.
Dina supported capping the price of insulin at $35. She has fought every Republican effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act, which provides health insurance to tens of thousands of Nevadans.
Dina is a strong advocate for the DREAM Act and comprehensive immigration reform that provides a legal pathway to citizenship.
Dina has worked to preserve NevadaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs special environment through creation of two national monuments. She also has fought to protect NevadaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs environment and its people through her three-decades-lon

She taught American and Nevada political science classes at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas from 1979 until 2011. A noted non-fiction writer, she is internationally known for her expertise in the history and policies related to nuclear power, weaponry and waste.
Dina is a proud Greek American and serves as Vice Chair of the Hellenic Caucus in Congress, representing her heritage and fostering cooperation between the United States and Greece. She has called for the reunification of Cyprus and protections for the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.
Dina grew up in the small town of Tifton, Georgia, with her parents, Joe and Betty Titus, and her younger sister, Dr. Rho Hudson, who is a professor of special education and a founding faculty member of Nevada State College. Dina is a graduate of the College of William and Mary, holds a master's degree from the University of Georgia, and earned her doctorate at Florida State University.
Dina has been married to Professor Thomas C. Wright for over 40 years. Tom, a Latin American historian, received the prestigious UNLV Distinguished Professor award in 2008 and is the author of a number of award-winning books, most notably on political exile and human rights. John Wright Hall on campus is named after his father, pioneer professor at UNLV.

Official Biography
Susie Lee was born to a working family of ten in Canton, Ohio. Her father was a military veteran who worked at a steel plant, while her mother stayed at home to care for the family of eight kids. After graduating from public schools, Susie worked her way through Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh with a combination of scholarships, loans, and part-time jobs.
In 1993, she moved to Las Vegas, where she became a leader in education nonprofits, founding the After School All Stars and later serving as President of Communities in Schools of Nevada. Under her leadership, Communities in Schools helped decrease dropout rates.
Since being elected to Congress in 2018, Susie has worked relentlessly with Democrats and Republicans a
---
like to achieve real results for Nevada families. She helped negotiate and get signed into law the once-in-generation Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, which lowered prescription drug costs for seniors and is the single biggest climate investment in U.S. history. Both bills are creating hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country.
Susie has led bipartisan legislation that was signed into law to help lower housing costs, protect NevadaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs water supply, expand access to health care, protect children from online sexual exploitation, and improve veteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ healthcare. Susie has also secured over $5.6 billion for Nevada through grants and federal investments.
Susie is ranked the number one most bipartisan member of Congress among all U.S. Representatives, Senators, and governors. She sits on the House Appropriations Committee. She is also the Co-Chair of the Bipartisan WomenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Caucus and is a member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus and New Democrats Coalition.
Susie is a battle-tested perennial Member of Congress who has won her swing district in the swing state of Nevada four times. Her district has a plurality of non-partisan voters. This Congress, Susie was elected Battleground Leadership Representative, a position she created in 2022 to ensure that Democratic House members representing the most competitive districts in the country have a seat at the Democratic Caucus leadership table.
Susie lives in Las Vegas and has two children. She is an outdoorswoman who loves to bike and hike.

Representative Horsford is a proven champion for NevadaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs working families. In the 118th Congress, he is committed to getting Nevada's economy back on track and restoring public faith in American institutions.
Rep. Horsford understands the challenges many families in NevadaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Fourth face each and every day.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  He fights for responsible gun control and background checks. He lost his father when he was 19 and empathizes with those who have experienced the pain of losing

a loved one to gun violence. His work has focused on ending the school-to-prison pipeline and providing the safety net children and families need to succeed. He has worked to strengthen children, families, and communities because these are priorities for so many Nevadans.
For more than a decade, Rep. Horsford led the Culinary Training Academy, the largest job training program in Nevada, helping thousands of workers find quality careers in the hospitality industry. A unique partnership between labor and business, the Culinary Training Academy under Rep. HorsfordÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs leadership placed over 80 percent of graduates into good-paying jobs and completed a multi-million capital construction campaign.
Rep. Horsford made history as NevadaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first African-American State Senate Majority Leader and he delivered. He passed the ""Clean Energy Jobs Initiative"" and positioned Nevada as a leader in renewable energy. When NevadaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs economy was devastated during the recession, Rep. Horsford worked across party lines to solve the worst budget crisis in state history.
While previously representing Nevadans in our nation's capital, Rep. Horsford worked to ensure veterans, senior citizens, and all Nevadans received the benefits they deserved, authored and passed the Nevada Lands Bill to create jobs across the state, and fought to protect a womanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs right to make her own healthcare decisions.
Most recently a small business owner, in partnership with Intel, Horsford worked to bring the first-of-its-kind workforce development program for youth and young adults to North Las Vegas. He helped to launch a food recovery program with Three Square and major employers like MGM Resorts to address food insecurity among needy children, families and seniors.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  He brings a principled focus on job creation, communit

Maggie Goodlander proudly represents New HampshireÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Second District. She was born and raised in Nashua ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the city that her family has called home for more than 100 years. Growing up in New Hampshire instilled in Maggie the values of community, citizenship, service, and that our democracy isnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt something you watch happen from the sidelines ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ itÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs something you participate in.
Maggie has dedicated her life to serving New Hampshire and our country and is fighting every day to ensure every Granite Stater gets a fair deal.
Maggie began her career working as a foreign policy advisor to Senator John McCain in the United States Senate where she helped write landmark sanctions legislation and strengthen democracy around the world. She went on to serve as an intelligence officer in the United States Navy Reserve for over a decade.
After graduating from law school and serving as a law clerk to Justice Stephen Breyer on the United States Supreme Court, Maggie returned to New Hampshire to fight for the most vulnerable Granite Staters and to teach constitutional law at the University of New Hampshire and Dartmouth.
Driven by her belief that no politician is above the law, Maggie served as counsel in the first impeach

ment of President Donald Trump. Maggie went on to the U.S. Department of Justice where she took on corporate monopolies as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General, committed to the idea that no corporation is above the law, either.
Before she was elected to represent New HampshireÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Second District in Congress in November 2024, Maggie served as a senior advisor at the White House where she led the Unity Agenda for the Nation, dedicated to solving five big challenges that unite us as a nation: beating the opioid epidemic, tackling our mental health crisis, holding Big Tech accountable, meeting our sacred obligation to veterans, and ending cancer as we know it.

Bonnie Watson Coleman is serving her sixth term in the United States House of Representatives, the continuation of a career in public service advocating for the needs of New Jersey families and the equitable treatment of all people. The first Black woman to represent New Jersey in Congress, Watson Coleman is a member of the Appropriations Committee and Budget Committee, as the Chair of the Democratic CaucusÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Task Force on Poverty, as a House Democratic Deputy Whip for Policy, and serves as a member of the Congressional Progressive CaucusÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Executive Board

nÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs work in the House centers on her belief that, in the United States of America, thereÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs a floor below which we should never allow any child, any family, any person to fall. Knowing that millions struggle every day just to make ends meet from the first to the last of the month, her legislative work seeks to bridge the gap for these Americans, making sure that the richest nation in the world doesnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt allow millions to live below the poverty line; doesnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt allow vulnerable groups to suffer the fallout of environmental violations; doesnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt allow profit margins to define the standards or the motivations for incarceration; and doesnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt allow bias to push everyday needs like car insurance out of reach for working families. SheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs introduced legislation aimed at solving issues like these, including:
The Healthy MOM Act, which would allow women to enroll in, or change their health coverage if they become pregnant;
the End For-Profit Prisons Act, which would prohibit the federal government from contracting with for-profit prison corporations;
the SAFER Pipelines Act that would reform the gas pipeline approval process overseen by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission;
the Customer Non-Discrimination Act, which would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity in ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂpublic accommodations,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ such as schools, recreational facilities and retail stores
The Pursuing Equity in Mental Health Act, legislation to address the disparities in access, care and study of mental health issues among people of color;

Watson, and her services in Congress continues a family legacy of public service, fighting for women, economically and socially disadvantaged populations, and other vulnerable groups in our society.

During her time as Majority Leader, Watson Coleman convened a year-long series of public hearings on reforms to prisoner re-entry programs while shepherding legislation through the Assembly that the New York Times called ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂa model for the rest of the nation,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ on prisoner rehabilitation and release.
In 2016, Watson Coleman founded the Congressional Caucus on Black Women and Girls alongside two of her colleagues, the first caucus aimed at bringing both the tremendous challenges and incredible successes of Black women to the fore in CongressÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs policy debates. In addition to continuing to co-chair the Caucus on Black Women and Girls and the role she serves with the Progressive Caucus, Watson Coleman is an active member of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Caucus for WomenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Issues, The Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, and the Congre

Full Biography
Meet Congressman Norcross
Born and raised in South Jersey, Donald is an electrician by trade and a proud union member. In Congress, he is committed to improving the lives of working families by focusing on the issues that matter most to them: raising wages and strengthening our economy, ensuring affordable access to a high-quality education, and supporting the brave men and women that protect our nation and our neighborhoods.
He knows firsthand what itÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs like to be a single parent having to balance work, family life and a checkbook. Donald began his career working for minimum wage, and his on-the-job experiences shape his work in Congress. Donald has been a f

ierce advocate for raising wages for workers, leading the House of Representatives to pass legislation that would gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025.
When construction work was slow or he was injured on the job, he was thankful for unemployment and disability insurance and knows what it is like to rely on these important resources. Since then, Donald has fought to lower prescription drug prices and ensure that everyone has access to affordable, quality healthcare, so that no one is forced to choose between putting dinner on the table or taking their medication.
Donald spent his career as an electrician connecting power to New Jersey businesses and industrial sites. He rose through the ranks and eventually became a business agent for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 351, as well as President of the Southern New Jersey AFL-CIO, where he advocated on behalf of thousands of hardworking men and women for nearly 20 years.
As a graduate of a Registered Apprenticeship program, Donald knows we need to advance job-training programs in America, and he also understands the value of a good education that doesnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt break the bank. As a former apprentice himself, Donald led the House in passing the National Apprenticeship Act, expanding access to skills training and connecting workers with stable, good-paying jobs. As a member of the New Jersey Legislature, he played a key role in historic higher education reforms that established New Jersey as a medical education and research hub.
As a member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, Donald is working to raise wages, protect the middle class, strengthen workplace protections and achieve equal pay and paid leave for those raising families. He also serves on the House Arm

Here, he focuses on protecting our national security, supporting service members and veterans and strengthening New JerseyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, which is set to receive a new fleet of KC-46 air refueling tankers ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ an effort pushed for by Donald.
Donald serves as the Vice Chair and Liaison to Labor for the Congressional Progressive Caucus. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has appointed him to be the Parliamentarian for the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, and he was one of four House Democrats appointed to the Joint Select Committee on Multiemployer Pensions to work on solutions for AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs retirement security crisis. He is also the co-founder of the Labor Caucus and the Building Trades Caucus.
Donald and his wife Andrea live in Camden City and are the proud parents of three adult children and grandparents of four.

dership and Priorities
Josh Gottheimer represents New JerseyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Fifth Congressional District in the northernmost part of the state, which includes parts of Bergen, Passaic, and Sussex counties. He was first sworn in on January 3, 2017, and is now in his fifth term in office.
In Congress, Josh serves on two Committees, including the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, where he is the Ranking Member of the National Security Agency and Cyber Subcommittee and is a member of the Defense Intelligence and Overhead Architecture Subcommittee. Josh also serves on the House Financial Services Committee, where he is a member of the Subcommittee on National Security, Illicit Finance, and International Financial Institutions, the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence, the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, and the Task Force on Monetary Policy, Treasury Market Resilience, and Economic Prosperity.
In January 2017, Josh was elected Co-Chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus and was reelected three times by his colleagues in 2019, 2021, and 2023. He currently serves as Vice-Chair, where he continues to promote commonsense over extremism and works across party lines on key issues, including lowering taxes, protecting our environment, making healthcare more affordable, protecting AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs national security, and improving infrastructure to help the American people.
Josh also serves as Co-Chair of the bipartisan SALT Caucus and Law Enforcement Caucus, and is a member of the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, the Blue Dog Coalition, and the New Democrat Coalition.
Just two months into his first term, Josh passed his first amendment in the House, which was later signed into law, to accelerate the hiring of post-9/11 v

eterans at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Josh has been named one of the top ten Members with the most amendments considered on the House floor.
As a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Josh understands that the safety and security of the United States is at a critical juncture, with rapidly evolving threats from foreign terrorists, and bad actors including China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and other oppressive regimes.
Josh is committed to lowering taxes and getting Fifth District residents a better return on the federal tax dollars they already send to Washington. In 2021 alone, by working with Fifth District mayors, councils, first responders, and towns, Josh helped claw back $750 from Washington for every household in the Fifth District ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a 357% increase from what the District has historically received. These dollars help first responders protect our communities while offsetting the strain on local budgets and property tax bills.
For his support for pro-growth policies and bipartisan governing, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has awarded Josh its Spirit of Enterprise Award every year he has served, as well as its first ever JeffersonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂHamilton Award for Bipartisanship. Given his consistent work on both sides of the aisle and with the Problem Solvers Caucus, Josh has been recognized multiple times as the most bipartisan Democrat in the House by the Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University. Josh has also received the Jefferson-Lincoln Award from the Panetta Institute for Public Policy.
During the 117th Congress, Josh played a key role in helping craft and pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the greatest infrastructure investment in a century. For New Jersey, this bipartisan bill will help build th
---
---
e new Gateway Train Tunnel, fix crumbling roads, bridges, rail, and NJ Transit, fight climate change, invest in ports, expand broadband access to the unconnected, get lead out of drinking water, address supply chain issues, create jobs, and boost our local economy.
Josh also helped get signed into law the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reduce our reliance on foreign countries like China, the PACT Act to expand VA health care and benefits for veterans exposed to burn pits and toxic substances, historic bipartisan gun safety legislation to keep children and families safe, and the Electoral Count Reform Act to help protect democracy.
In fall of 2022, JoshÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs bipartisan, bicameral legislation ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the Invest to Protect Act ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ passed the House by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 360 to 64. Josh introduced the bill with former sheriff Rep. John Rutherford (FL-4) to make critical, targeted investments in the recruitment, retention, support, and training police need to protect themselves and the communities they serve. Josh currently serves as Co-Chair of the House Law Enforcement Caucus.
Josh is dedicated to combating antisemitism and strengthening the historic U.S.-Israel relationship. Josh helped secure passage of legislation reaffirming the Obama-Biden AdministrationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ten year U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), fighting the BDS movement, and investing in the Iron Dome program.
Background
Josh was raised in North Caldwell, the son of a preschool teacher and a small business owner. Growing up, Josh worked in his fatherÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs store and, like your average New Jersey kid, treasured summer vacations at the Jersey Shore. His first concert was at the Meadowlands to see the one and only Bruce Springsteen!
Josh graduated from
---
---
 West Essex High School before attending the University of Pennsylvania, later becoming a Thouron Fellow at Oxford, and then paid his way through Harvard Law School.
After finishing college, Josh went on to work in the Clinton White House as one of the youngest presidential speechwriters in history. Josh wrote speeches on topics ranging from the global economy to technology and innovation to combating crime; he also helped draft two State of the Union Addresses.
After leaving the White House, Josh worked at the Ford Motor Company, where he helped rebuild the iconic auto companyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs image and worked on the first American hybrid. Josh was also a Senior Advisor to the Chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and published the book ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRipples of Hope: Great American Civil Rights Speeches.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
Josh later served as Senior Counselor to the Chairman at the Federal Communications Commission. During his tenure, he was the first Director of Office of Public-Private Initiatives, partnering with private companies to break through roadblocks and solve national problems. These partnerships saved taxpayers money while helping law enforcement, boosting digital education, and creating jobs. Josh worked on cybersecurity, broadband adoption, combating cell phone theft, creating a new public safety emergency alert system, and expanding wireless spectrum. Josh used that experience to help create a nonprofit, JerseyOn, that has expanded access to high-speed internet for low-income New Jersey students to help them compete in the 21st Century economy.
Before running for Congress, Josh worked at Microsoft as General Manager for Corporate Strategy, where he focused on the companyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs expansion into the cloud, e-commerce, and privacy. He was also a member of both the Ridgewood and New Jersey Chambers o

f Commerce, the Rutgers Business School Advisory Board, and was a visiting fellow at Princeton UniversityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Center for Information Technology Policy. He also taught history at the University of Pennsylvania.
JoshÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs approach to public service is rooted in his experience in both the public and private sectors. During his time working with President Clinton, Dr. Mary Frances Berry, Senator Frank Lautenberg, and Speaker Thomas Foley, he saw that, by seeking common ground, it is possible to find a bipartisan path forward without compromising your core values. Josh firmly believes that it does not matter if an idea comes from the Democratic or Republican side of the aisle, only whether it will help our great country and the communities and people of New Jersey.
Josh lives in Tenafly, New Jersey,
with Marla, his wife who was a federal prosecutor, and their two children, Ellie and Ben.

Biography

Frank Pallone, Jr. is serving his 18th full term in the U.S. House of Representatives. Pallone represents New Jersey's
6th Congressional District
, which covers most of Middlesex County, as well as the Bayshore and oceanfront areas of Monmouth County.
Throughout his career, Pallone has fought to make health care more affordable and accessible, protect and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid, and make the country's food system safer. Pallone has also fought to protect New Jersey's environment, including protecting our coast from dangerous offshore drilling, holding corporate polluters accountable for Superfund clean ups, and bolstering coastal resiliency. He is also a champion of the state's commercial and recreational fishing industries.
Pallone is the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the oldest continuous standing committee in the House that has one of the broadest jurisdictions of any congressional committee. 
---
The Committee's jurisdiction includes, but is not limited to, issues pertaining to health care, energy, environment, commerce, food and drug safety, consumer protection, and communications and technology.
In 2010, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, Pallone played a key role in authoring and passing the Affordable Care Act.
During the 117
th
Congress (2021-2022), as Chairman of the full Committee, Pallone was a leader in the fight to pass the
Inflation Reduction Act
ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe most significant climate law in our nation's history. The law will also lower prescription drug and health care costs for millions of Americans, while finally empowering Medicare to negotiate the cost of lifesaving prescription drugs for seniors, which Pallone has championed for years.
Pallone was also instrumental in the passage of the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
that has
delivered federal funding to New Jersey to bolster the state's electric vehicle infrastructure
, invest in safe drinking water, and deploy affordable broadband. It also tackles dangerous PFAS chemicals and funds Superfund and brownfield cleanups. In addition, he also helped usher into law the
CHIPS and Science Act
to strengthen our economy and boost our domestic manufacturing industry.
In a
federal spending bill for fiscal year 2023
, Pallone fought for the inclusion of legislation that provides the Food and Drug Administration with the tools and resources it needs to oversee the cosmetics industry, which he first proposed over a decade ago. He also successfully pushed for provisions to provide continuous coverage for children and new mothers through Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.
Pallone also continues to advocate for New Jersey,
securing community projects in Middlesex and Monmouth County
that will he
---
lp rebuild infrastructure, promote public health, and bolster educational funding. He has also led efforts to successfully ban offshore drilling and ocean dumping to protect New JerseyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs coastline. He works constantly with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to complete multiple beach replacement projects at the Jersey Shore.
Pallone began his political career in Long Branch, where he was born and still resides. He was elected to the Long Branch City Council in 1982. In 1983, he was elected to the state Senate, representing the Monmouth County coastline. He was re-elected in 1987.
On November 8, 1988, Pallone was elected to the House of Representatives from New Jersey's former Third District, which included parts of Monmouth and Ocean counties. After a new Congressional district map was adopted in 1992, Pallone was elected to represent the Sixth District that included large portions of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties in November of the same year.
Pallone's Central Jersey district is an ethnically diverse area that includes New Brunswick, Asbury Park, and Perth Amboy. It includes Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, and Monmouth University.
Pallone married his wife Sarah in 1992. They have three adult children, Rose, Celeste, and Frank.

Congressman Robert J. Menendez represents the place where he grew up and that he calls home, New Jersey's Eighth Congressional District. The District includes most of Hudson County, the East and North Wards of the City of Newark in Essex County, and the City of Elizabeth in Union County. He was first sworn in on January 3, 2023.
Raised in Union City as the grandson of Cuban immigrants and strong union members, Rob was born to a community leader and a public school educator who instilled in him at an early age the spirit and value of public service and giving back to his community.
Prior to being elected to the House of Representatives, Rob served as a Commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. He was the first Latino from New Jersey to serve on the Board and the first millennial Port Authority Commissioner. Rob served as Chair of the Governance and Ethics Committee and was a member of the Finance Committee, which exercises oversight over the agency's multi-billio

n dollar budget. During his time as a Commissioner, the Port Authority - through the leadership of its dedicated staff and employees - completed several critical infrastructure projects, including some of the Port Authority's largest investments benefitting New Jersey commuters, most notably Newark Liberty International Airport's $2.7 billion state-of-the-art Terminal A, expansion of the PATHÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs capacity with its nine-car train project, planning for a new Midtown Bus Terminal, and record-setting activity at its ports.
An attorney, Rob previously worked at the national law firm of Lowenstein Sandler LLP. At Lowenstein, Rob served as outside counsel to a wide range of companies in the finance and technology spaces, often working with founders and executives of traditionally underrepresented backgrounds. His work helped to enable their success and promoted growth in their communities. He also worked with The Lowenstein Sandler Center for the Public Interest to serve communities and clients in need of pro bono representation.
Rob is a strong proponent of increasing affordability, battling climate change, increasing the supply of affordable housing, making neighborhoods safer from senseless gun violence, and investing in mass transit and transportation infrastructure - all issues that impact residents of the Eighth Congressional District on a daily basis.
Rob currently sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, as well as the Subcommittees on Energy, Environment, and Communications and Technology.  He also serves as a Regional Whip for the House Democratic Caucus, a position that assists the Democratic Whip operation to track votes and legislation that will move the House DemocratsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ agenda forward.
In the 119th Congress, Rob has joined several caucuses, including the Co

Congressman Gabe Vasquez is a first-generation Mexican-American who served as a City Councilor in Las Cruces.
Congressman Vasquez grew up in the borderlands and saw the value of hard work in his family while growing up. As the first in his family to be born in the United States, heÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs made the most of his opportunity and has worked hard to make a positive difference in his community and in the lives of others. Congressman Vasquez is a champion for working families, he believes we need to build an economy that benefits everyone.
In 2013, after helping build one of Las CrucesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ most successful startup companies, Congressman Vasquez joined Senator HeinrichÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs staff and worked across southern New Mexico to solve problems for
---
New Mexico businesses, communities, and families. Vasquez was also instrumental in the designation of the Organ Mountains Desert Peaks National Monument, protecting it from harmful development and safeguarding it for future generations.
In 2017, Congressman Vasquez was elected to the Las Cruces City Council with over 70 percent of the vote. In this role, he delivered millions of dollars in investment to create and improve parks, updated the districtÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs infrastructure, promoted policy that created thousands of jobs, and helped craft a comprehensive development plan that focused on lifting families out of poverty. In prior years, Congressman Vasquez has served as the executive director of the Las Cruces Hispano Chamber of Commerce, worked in public lands conservation, and as a policy advocate promoting child welfare and family wellbeing at the federal level.
Vasquez was elected to represent New MexicoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 2nd district in November 2022.

Congresswoman Teresa Leger FernÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡ndez represents the beautiful and beautifully diverse 3rd Congressional District of New Mexico.
Teresa is a daughter of rural New Mexico and 17th generation New Mexican. Born in Las Vegas, New Mexico, she was part of the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first Head Start class. She went on to graduate from Yale and Stanford Law School.

ters. She also served as an acequia commissioner.
As a public interest lawyer, she helped secure nearly a billion dollars for and then helped build schools, rural health clinics, broadband, businesses, affordable housing, and critical infrastructure for New Mexico. She was also a Clinton and Obama presidential appointee and worked as a White House Fellow on housing issues and as Vice Chair of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.
In Congress, Teresa serves on the House Rules Committee. Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries placed his trust in the congresswoman to represent Democrats in this powerful committee. She also serves on the House Committee on Natural Resources as the Ranking Member of its Subcommittee on Indian and Insular Affairs. As Ranking Member, her focus is to promote tribal sovereignty and improve life for all Native Americans. When Leger FernÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡ndez was chair of the subcommittee, the 117th Congress made the largest investments in Indian Country in generations and passed the CongresswomanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs STOP Act to protect sacred items from being illegally trafficked.
For her advocacy and work for womenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs rights, TeresaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs colleagues elected her Chair of the
Democratic Women's Caucus
in 2024. Teresa also serves as a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
Teresa is the Co-Chair of the National Labs Caucus, the Rural Broadband Caucus, and the Head Start to Congress Caucus. She is also a proud member of the following: Congressional Progressive Caucus, Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Diabetes Caucus, Labor Caucus, LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, Mental Health Caucus, Bipartisan Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Task Force, Historic Preservation Caucus, National Heritage Area Caucus, Native American Caucus, PFAS Caucus, Pro-Choice Caucus, Bipartisan Rural Health Cau

When the U.S. Forest Service started the biggest fire in New MexicoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs history in April of 2022, people lost their homes, their ranches, and their livelihoods. Teresa knew the USFS must be held accountable and secured a pause on prescribed burns. She helped pass the Hermit's Peak Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act securing $3.95 billion to create an entirely new program to compensate victims of the fire and pay for the replacement of the damaged Las Vegas water treatment facility so that residents could have access to clean water.
Teresa believes everyone needs access to health care no matter their income, insurance, or zip code. Quality and affordable health care is essential for our communities to thrive. As a breast cancer survivor, she understands how important it is to protect individuals with pre-existing conditions. As someone who lost two brothers to addiction, she wants to make sure no family experiences the same pain that her family did. In Congress, she introduced the Campus Prevention and Recovery Services for Students Act to address alcohol and substance use on college campuses. She also introduced the Home of Your Own Act to create a national homeownership assistance grant program to help address the current housing crisis and bring down the cost of homeownership.

Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis is serving her third term representing New YorkÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 11th Congressional District which encompasses Staten Island and parts of Southern Brooklyn. Malliotakis is a member of the House Committee on Ways and Means and throughout her tenure she hasÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ been focused onÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ making AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs cities safe again,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ securing the southern border,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ tackling inflation to strengthen our economy andÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ unleashing AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs energy potential.
MalliotakisÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ office has resolved over 21,000 constituent cases, helpedÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 193 immigrantsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ become United States citizens, and delivered over $220 million to the district including federal funding for the NYPD, U.S. Coast Guard Sector New York, local sewer projects, several area hospitals, and the St. George Theatre.
Malliotakis delivered on her promise to secure New YorkÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs fair share of federal mass transit funding as a previous member of the House Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure with her vote for the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Over $100 million has already been committed to NY-11 from the IIJA for various projects including the rehabilitation of bridges over the Staten Island Expressway, GowanusÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Expressway, and dred

ging in Arthur Kill Terminal. Malliotakis also worked to get the Staten Island Seawall Project back on track after costly redesign requests made by the city caused years of delays and has ensured the federal share of the project will be fully funded to completion alleviating the financial burden on the city and state.
As a previous member of the House Committee of Foreign Affairs, Malliotakis has been a strong voice for American values overseas, reducing our reliance on China and against the spread of communism in Central and South America. She has stood up for our allies, such as Greece, Cyprus, and Israel against neighboring authoritarian regimes. Malliotakis successfully inserted language into the National Defense Authorization Act requiring more transparency regarding IranÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs nefarious activities on U.S. soil and helped pass a bipartisan amendment establishing congressional oversight on any sale of F-16 fighter jets and military equipment to Turkey.
Prior to Congress, Malliotakis spent five terms in the New York State Assembly where she fought to restore ethics in Albany, expand transit service in her district, improve programs for senior citizens, reform education, better New YorkÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs economic climate and help her community rebuild after Hurricane Sandy.
Malliotakis is the daughter of immigrants, her father from Greece, and her mother a Cuban exile of the Castro dictatorship. She is a passionate advocate for animal rights and the strengthening of animal cruelty laws. In her spare time, Malliotakis enjoys spending time with her new chihuahua, Luna.

""Jerry Nadler is a staunch defender of civil rights and civil liberties in America, and a passionate advocate for these issues in Congress.""
-- Representative John Lewis (D-GA), Civil Rights leader
For over 30 years, in both the House and in the New York State Assembly, Congressman Nadler has proudly been on the front lines in the fight for civil rights, and has been a relentless defender of our countryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs fundamental promise of equality for all.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Central among his concerns has been the ongoing civil rights struggle for people of color.

He also has worked vigorously to call attention and seek remedies to past and present racial injustices.  Rep. Nadler was an original co-sponsor of the
Pigford Claims Remedy Act of 2007

, which he ushered through to a decisive House victory.
Congressman Nadler has also taken an active role in working against discriminatory racial profiling by law enforcement, co-sponsoring the

among other actions, and has devoted considerable time as a senior Member of the House Judiciary Committee to monitoring and reinforcing voting rights for African-Americans and other groups that have been systematically disenfranchised.  He was one of the first to call for a Justice Department investigation in 2000 of Mayor Giuliani and then-NYPD Commissioner Howard Safir after three separate fatal shootings involving three unarmed New YorkersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂPatrick Dorismond, Amadou Diallo, and Gideon BuschÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂand was an outspoken advocate for justice in the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner in 2014.  In his district, Rep. Nadler successfully worked to create the African Burial Ground National Historic Site in Lower Manhattan, recognizing the landmark 17

A Vice-Chair and founding member of the House Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Equality Caucus, and the first from New YorkÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs congressional delegation to openly support marriage equality, Rep. Nadler has been an original co-sponsor of every major piece of LGBT civil rights legislation for the last twenty-plus years. He personally authored the
Respect for Marriage Act (RMA),
the
Uniting American Families Act (UAFA),
the
Father Mychal Judge Act,
and the
Equal Access to Social Security Act
, marking his place as a central architect of LGBT legislative strategy in Congress.  He led the fight in the House against the
Defense of Marriage Act
and the
Federal Marriage Amendment
and continues to oppose anti-gay efforts as they emerge in Congress.  Additionally, Rep. Nadler authored and led the Congressional amicus briefs in the two most significant marriage equality-related cases to go to the Supreme CourtÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂboth

NadlerÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs record, saying: ""Jerry Nadler has been a vigorous, unyielding, active supporter of fairness for gay men and lesbians on every relevant issue since he came to Congress.""

Violence Against Women Act
and the author of the
Pregnant Workers Fairness Act
.  In recognition of his leadership in the area of equal pay, Rep. Nadler was invited to join President Obama at the White House for the signing of the
Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act
.
Representative Nadler is nationally recognized as a staunch defender of womenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs health, including a womanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs constitutional right to access an abortion.  As a senior Member of the House Judiciary Committee and a leader in the House Pro-Choice Caucus, he has often taken a central role in standing up to conservative attacks against every AmericanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs right to make personal decisions about reproductive health, including devising the strategy to defeat countless anti-choice bills and carrying the movementÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs signature piece of legislation -- the
Freedom of Choice Act
.  Because of his strong voice defending such rights, in 2015 Rep. Nadler was named by Leader Nancy Pelosi as one of six Democratic Members (and the only male Member) chosen to serve on the RepublicansÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Select Committee shamefully set up to attack womenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs health organizations like Planned Parenthood, which provides lifesaving reproductive health services to millions of women and families across the country.
Rep. Nadler has also been a life-long advocate for the differently-abled, shepherding the
Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007
through the House.
Even early in his career in the State Assembly, Rep. Nadler was a major civil rights voice. He passed the first bills protecting People with AIDS (PWAs) from discrimination and served as a key womenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs rights advocate, garnering the New York State Chapter of the National Organization for WomenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ""Legislator
---
 of the Year"" Award, the first and one of only two men to ever receive this honor.
Defending Civil Liberties
""Jerry Nadler is a gifted constitutional scholar and the conscience of the House.""
-- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi
As a nationally recognized leader on civil liberties, Congressman Nadler has fought for protections against unwarranted government interference in our personal affairs and has been called ""one of the HouseÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs most stalwart defenders of the Constitution"" by the American Civil Liberties Union. His legislation to remove the most pernicious elements of the
USA PATRIOT Act
and stop the NSAÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs dragnet surveillance of Americans has won him praise from organizations and individuals spanning the political and ideological spectrum. In 2015, he was one of four Members of the U.S. House of Representatives to author the bipartisan
USA Freedom Act
ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂending the illegal collection of bulk data by the NSAÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe passage of which represented the first significant reform of government surveillance carried out by the federal government since 1978.
Another hallmark of Rep. NadlerÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs career is his commitment to due process rights for the accused, his work to prevent prosecutorial over-zealousness and misconduct, and his staunch advocacy against the use of illegal torture methods.
Congressman Nadler serves as a champion in the House for free speech and free expression. He has often taken difficult votes on controversial issues in order to remain true to his principles and the fundamental belief in the rights guaranteed under the First Amendment. He is one of CongressÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs most vocal defenders of the separation of church and state and of AmericansÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ right to exercise their religion freely, while also denouncing efforts by some to use religion as an excuse to discriminate. Rep.

Nadler was one of the lead Democratic sponsors of the
Religious Freedom Restoration Act
(RFRA) and the author of the
Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act
(RLUIPA), which ensure that individuals are able to assert their religious beliefs without jeopardizing the freedom and rights of others.  He also has opposed state-based laws with similar titles that were specifically designed to discriminate against LGBT Americans.
Throughout his career, Congressman Nadler has adamantly supported the right to free speech and assembly for protestors, including during the 2004 Republican National Convention and the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations, which centered in his district.
Improving Our Transportation and Infrastructure
""[Jerry Nadler] is the best advocate for public works and infrastructure we have ever had in Congress. He gets it! ""
-- Former House Speaker, Richard Gephardt
From his days as Chair of the Committee on Mass Transit and Rail Freight in the New York State Assembly, to his current position as the most senior Northeastern member on the House Transportation Committee, Congressman Nadler has long been considered a key expert and leading voice on transportation issues.  His entire career in public service has been spent working to increase funding for important transportation and infrastructure projects that move both people and goods.  He is a fierce advocate for urban transit, particularly New YorkÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs mass transit systems, and for improved roads and infrastructure, as well as for effective and sustainable goods movement in New York and nationwide.  As former Co-Chair of the Congressional Transit Caucus and the Fair Coalition, Rep. Nadler has led the national fight to increase federal funding for mass transit and for equitable formulas that ensure tran

sit-dependent states get their proper share of highway funding.
""What has made [Rep. Nadler] truly stand out is his devotion in improving the city's infrastructure, particularly rail freight and the future of New York Harbor. On this issue he has been nothing less than a visionary, leading the call for the crucial revitalization of the port of New York.""
-- New York Daily News
For over three decades, Congressman Nadler has been at the forefront of efforts to more efficiently move goods in New York by reconnecting the City to the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs freight rail system via the construction of a tunnel under New York Harbor.  The Cross Harbor Rail Freight Tunnel would fundamentally decrease New YorkÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs over-dependence on truck-borne freight by taking up to 1 million trucks off City streets annually.  This would help solve New York's major traffic congestion issues, eliminate a built-in cap on economic development, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by thousands of tons, improve public health, and address a major national security vulnerability.  Rep. Nadler has also been a dedicated supporter of the New York/New Jersey Port District. He is a fierce promoter of regional maritime commerce, working to ensure that New York sees its fair share of key benefits from maritime-related economic development.  In this regard, he has led a decades-long fight to preserve BrooklynÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Red Hook Container Port, and has served as the leading advocate for the creation of a deep water container port in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.
Recovering from the 9/11 Attacks
""Representative Jerrold Nadler has played an extraordinary role in raising questions about the environmental and occupational hazards caused by the collapse of the World Trade Center and the fires that burned at Ground Zero for more than four months.""

New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health
After the devastating 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, which stood in the CongressmanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs district, Rep. Nadler led the fight in Congress and at the White House to secure $20 billion for recovery work, and consistently spoke up for New York when the rebuilding effort required help from the federal government.
In the aftermath of the attacks, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) refused to properly test and cleanup buildings contaminated by the collapse of the Twin Towers, and falsely declared it safe for workers, residents, and students to return to the area. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Congressman Nadler led the fight for a more comprehensive cleanup and held hearings in which former EPA head Christine Todd Whitman was forced to admit that the Agency had lied about the air quality in Lower Manhattan. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Juan Gonzalez of the Daily News wrote, ""Of all the politicians in this town, Nadler has fought the hardest to get EPA to assume responsibility for indoor cleanup."" These hearings also laid the groundwork for the federal government to take responsibility for treating and compensating 9/11 responders and survivors. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ This responsibility was enshrined in the
James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010
, of which Rep. Nadler was a co-author. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ As a leading proponent for its reauthorization, Rep. Nadler continued to advocate for the health and well-being of those directly affected by the attacks on 9/11, ensuring the full reauthorization of
Zadroga
as part of the FY2016 Omnibus Appropriations bill.
Congressman Nadler has also fought for homeland security improvements to prevent future attacks. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ He helped author the provision of the
Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007
(PL 110-53) based on his

Supporting Israel and Combating Anti-Semitism
""[Jerry] Nadler has spent his life and career as one of the most steadfast supporters of IsraelÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs security.""
-- Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY)
Jerry Nadler has consistently been recognized as one of IsraelÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs strongest supporters in the U.S. House of RepresentativesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂworking diligently towards ensuring a safe, secure, peaceful, and democratic IsraelÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂand has often been a leader on the key issues of ever-strengthened U.S.-Israel cooperation and U.S. foreign aid.  Congressman Nadler has long been a leading voice in support of a two-state solution, seeing it as critical to protecting IsraelÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs long-term strategic and security interests.  As such, he has consistently supported Middle East peace efforts, as well as direct negotiations between the parties, knowing full well that no resolution can be agreed upon until both sides feel that their needs are addressed.  He has continually insisted that the U.S. affirm IsraelÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs right to self-defense, and has been a strong supporter of legislation that puts pressure on Iran for its illegal development of nuclear weapons, its support of terrorism, and IranÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs other illicit and destabilizing conduct in the region. With Congressional passage of the Iran nuclear deal, which Congressman Nadler voted to support (to read his full statement

), Rep. Nadler has worked vigorously to ensure that the United States demands full Iranian compliance with the agreement and that the Administration continues to enforce related international laws and non-nuclear sanctions. To this end, since the signing of 
---

the Agreement, he has been an outspoken advocate for the need to take action against Iranian illicit behavior, including its illegal ballistic missile testing, its support of terrorist organizations like Hezbollah, and its continued human rights abuses.
""Jerry Nadler is an ardent supporter of Israel. He is a man with a heart, a head, and considerable ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂsaichelÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ (good sense).""
-- Janet Weinman, Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer of Hadassah and former Chair of the New York Jewish Community Relations Council
As representative of the largest and most diverse Jewish community in any congressional district in the United States, Congressman Nadler has also been an outspoken leader against anti-Semitism and continues to lead a variety of efforts to stymie the growing anti-Zionist, anti-Jewish rhetoric and campaigns which seek to delegitimize Israel on the world stage. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ This includes authoring a House-passed Resolution (H.Res.707) in 2014, condemning all forms of anti-Semitism and rejecting attempts to justify such hatred or violent attacks as an acceptable expression of disapproval or frustration over political events in the Middle East or elsewhere. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Congressman Nadler was one of the first Members of Congress to directly challenge the so-called Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, when, in its nascent form, it hi-jacked the UN Conference on Racism in Durban for its own political purposes.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Since then, Rep. Nadler, with his highly-regarded progressive political voice, has been considered particularly well-suited to challenge the BDS movement as destructive to Middle East peace when its supporters seek to make inroads on campuses and elsewhere across the country.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  He has worked very closely with the Jewish Federations of North AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs (JFNA)

Leading on Internet and Technology Issues
""[Congressman] Nadler was Silicon AlleyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs earliest serious political defenders.""
-- Silicon Alley Reporter Magazine
Congressman Nadler represents one of the main tech-hubs of the East CoastÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂalso known as Silicon AlleyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂand is viewed as a fierce promoter for the technology industry.  As a strong proponent of net neutrality, he has long opposed pay-to-play agreements, as well as blocking and discrimination of content, and has urged the FCC to reclassify broadband providers as common carriers.  In early 2015, Rep. Nadler reintroduced the
Innovation Act
, which would address the problem of shell companies, otherwise known as patent trolls, that seek to force financial settlements from businesses with threats of expensive lawsuits over very weak claims of patent infringement.
Representative Nadler has also taken principled stands on important technology-related issues, being an outspoken advocate in fighting against the overreach of the National Security Agency (NSA).  He introduced the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act Modernization Act
in 2012, which would enhance protections for private communications stored on remote computing services, and in 2014 helped lead House Judiciary Committee efforts to reform NSA spying programs and protect AmericansÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ privacy.

Supporting the Artists and the Arts  
""The nation knows him as a protector of civil liberties, defender of womenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs rights, promoter of access to health care and an expert on Middle East policy, but in addition to all of that we know him as a champion of another group that the law has left behind and thatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs music creators.""  
-- Neil Portnow, President and CEO of the Recording Academy (GRAMMYs)  

Representing a district widely recognized as an epicenter of artistic and creative activity, Congressman Nadler has taken a particular interest in the protection of artistsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ rights.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  He is the lead sponsor of the  
American Royalties Too (ART) Act  
, which would require resale royalties be paid to visual artists when their work is resold and allow them to benefit when their work increases in value. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ He has also shown a particular interest in solving difficult and complex issues for music creators. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Rep. Nadler introduced the  
Fair Play Fair Pay Act  
to establish a terrestrial (AM/FM) performance right, and require all forms of radio to pay the same fair market value to performing artists and musicians, including music recorded prior to 1972. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Enactment of these bills would correct two of the biggest U.S. copyright law injustices against artists and would bring the United States in line with the rest of the developed world.  

Representative Nadler is a longtime, leading member of the Congressional Arts Caucus and created ""Americans for the NEA"", which brought pro-arts advocates from around the country to Washington to lobby against attempts to cut funding for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). He has also consistently fought for
---
funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ He has helped secure hundreds of millions of dollars for New YorkÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs arts and cultural institutions, including Lincoln Center, the Met, the Museum of Natural History, the Museum of African Art, the NY Public Library for the Performing Arts, and many more institutions across the district.
Serving as a Strong, Principled Progressive Voice
""From his first days in politics, Nadler has been a true reformerÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¦ From defending abortion access to fighting for the environment and the arts, Nadler has done the right thing time after time.""
-- New York Daily News
As a veteran member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Jerry Nadler has been a champion of progressive causes both in New York and throughout the country. As one of CongressÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ leaders on affordable housing, Rep. Nadler has garnered hundreds of millions of dollars for the Section 8 program -- just one of many accomplishments that led the New York Daily News to call him, ""the liberal lion of the New York delegation."" He has also fought vigorously against cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and SNAP benefits, and has been an aggressive supporter of health care expansion in order to maintain the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs social safety net.
As a life-long advocate for working people, Congressman Nadler has promoted progressive economic development policy in New York, supporting good-paying union jobs, as well as national public policy solutions to end income inequality. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ This includes leading House efforts to reform the countryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs bankruptcy laws in order to better protect average Americans.
""Strongly liberal, with a civil rights bent, [Jerry Nadler] is considered CongressÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ resident intellectual.""

Early Life  
Born in the Parkchester neighborhood of The Bronx, AlexandriaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs parents movedÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  the family 30 minutes north to Yorktown in search of a stronger public school for her and her brother. AlexandriaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs mother was born and raised in Puerto Rico and worked throughout her childhood as a domestic worker. AlexandriaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs father was a second-generation Bronxite, who ran a small business in The Bronx. Throughout her childhood, Representative Ocasio-Cortez traveled regularly to The Bronx to spend time with her extended family. From an early age, the stark contrast in educational opportunities available to her and her cousins, based on their respective zip codes, made an impression on her.  
After high school, Alexandria attended Boston University, and graduated with degrees in Economics and International Relations (and tens of thousands of dollars in student loans). Durin

g this period she also had the opportunity to intern in the office of the late Senator Ted Kennedy. Her role in Senator KennedyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs office provided a firsthand view of the heartbreak families endured after being separated by ICE. These experiences led the Congresswoman to organize Latinx youth in The Bronx and across the United States, eventually, she began work as an Educational Director with the National Hispanic Institute, a role in which she helped Americans, DREAMers and undocumented youth in community leadership and college readiness.
Following the financial crisis of 2008, tragedy struck when her father passed away suddenly from cancer. The medical bills and other growing expenses placed their home at risk of foreclosure. Alexandria pulled extra shifts to work as a waitress and bartender to support her family, deepening her commitment to issues impacting working-class people.
First Political Campaign
During the 2016 presidential election, Alexandria worked as a volunteer organizer for Bernie Sanders in the South Bronx, expanding her skills in electoral organizing and activism.
Shortly thereafter, she was inspired by demonstrations being led by indigenous communities at Standing Rock, South Dakota in opposition to a new pipeline. She decided to travel across the country to join them, and left the experience resolved to dedicate her life to public service. A few months later, she launched her first campaign for Congress.
ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂThe campaign was a long shot from the start. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂEveryone said, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂSheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs really cute, but maybe next time,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Ocasio-Cortez recalls.

In June 2018, AlexandriaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs campaign shocked the political establishment, when she defeated incumbent Joe Crowley. Her campaign was driven entirely by grassroots volunteers and donations. The Congresswoman refused to take any contributions from corporations, a practice she continues to this day.
First Term
In January of 2019, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez was sworn-in as the youngest woman and youngest Latina ever to serve in Congress.
Her first piece of legislation was the Green New Deal resolution
, which envisions a 10-year national mobilization, akin to FDRÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs New Deal, that would put millions to work in good-paying, union jobs repairing the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs infrastructure, reducing air and water pollution, and fighting the intertwined economic, social, racial and climate crises crippling the country.
Over her first term, she introduced a total of 23 pieces of legislation.
Among them is her Loan Shark Prevention Act, which would cap credit card interest rates at 15%. The Congresswoman also introduced a group of bills collectively titled ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂJust Society,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ which would raise the federal poverty line, include immigrants in social safety net programs, require federal contractors to pay a living wage, strengthen renters' rights, and decrease recidivism.
In her first term, the Congresswoman saw three amendments pass into law, despite Republican control of the Senate and Presidency.
One shifted $5 million from the failed war on drugs to treatment for opioid addiction and another secured $10 million to clean up toxic bombardment sites in Puerto Rico. Most notably, the Congresswoman also worked wi

ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂThere are some politicians who are very good on policy, and there are some politicians who are good communicators, and there are some politicians that have a way about them that relates very well to ordinary people. Alexandria has all three of those characteristics.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Senator Bernie Sanders
The Congresswoman also quickly gained a reputation as an effective questioner in committee hearings.
Through committee hearings, she pressured a major pharmaceutical company into lowering the price of a drug that reduces HIV transmission; forced a defense contractor to return $16.1 million in federal funding; and got Michael Cohen to state on the record that President Donald Trump was engaging in tax fraud and to divulge other information that helped the New York Attorney General open an investigation into the Trump Organization.
The Congresswoman also maintained a commitment to doing a town hall nearly every month of her first term, hosting a total of 25 town halls, all of which provided language translation services and accessibility for the hearing impaired. The District Office also opened cases for 1,400 constituents, assisting with everything from immigration visas and Social Security payments to small business loans and veterans benefits. Various institutions in NY-14 also received $470M in federal grants during our first term.
Second Term

In January 2021, Rep. AOC was sworn-in for her second term in Congress. Just a few days later, on January 6, the Capitol was breached for the first time since the War of 1812. Along with several colleagues, Rep. AOC hid in one o

f the office buildings until the Capitol was secured and the House was called to vote to verify the results of the 2020 presidential election. In the wake of the attacks, the Congresswoman called to expel Members of Congress who had voted to invalidate the elections and who had urged on those domestic terrorists that attacked the Capitol. She also voted for a second time to impeach President Trump.
In March, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ President BidenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs plan to help the nation recover from COVID-19.
The Congresswoman and other progressives fought hard to include key provisions, including an expanded Child Tax Credit, which most families began receiving in monthly installments that summer.
ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂWhen I ask [Rep. Ayanna] Pressley what popular narratives [about Rep. Ocasio-Cortez] miss, she cites humility. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂShe certainly did not set out to be an icon or even a history maker. I think it was her destiny, but there is no calculation.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ As Ocasio-Cortez puts it, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂI donÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt want to be a savior, I want to be a mirror.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ - Vanity Fair, October 28, 2020.
In April 2021, the Congresswoman reintroduced her Green New Deal resolution ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ growing the list of co-sponsors to over 115.
In the three years since the resolution was first introduced, the Green New Deal has inspired over a dozen pieces of legislation and 10 regional Green New Deals.
In August 2021,
after the federal eviction moratorium expired, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez joined Rep. Cori Bush for a sit-in on the Capitol Steps that lasted several days.
Ultimately, the Biden administration reversed its position and extended the ban. Though their executive order was struck down by conservatives on the Supreme Court several weeks later, this time was invaluable for families and landlords trying to access Emergency Rental Relief and st

Later that month,
Rep. Ocasio-Cortez worked with the State Department to help Afghan evacuees.
Along with Rep. Barbara Lee, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez led 70 Members of Congress in calling on the Biden administration to increase the cap on refugees to 200,000 people.
In September, unprecedented floods devastated the CongresswomanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs district and other parts of New York and New Jersey.
Sadly, several constituents were killed ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ having drowned in basement apartments. In the aftermath, the Congresswoman worked with the President and others to get one of the fastest FEMA disaster declarations in history. So far, almost 25,000 New York families have received $165 million in assistance.
By the end of 2021, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez had submitted 30 amendments,
including one which doubled the funding to replace and update lead water infrastructure in schools and childcare programs ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and another which prohibited funds from being used to provide weapons or military aid or military training to Saudi ArabiaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Rapid Intervention Force (RIF), the unit responsible for the murder of U.S. journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
In March of 2022, President Biden signed into law an omnibus bill to keep the federal government funded and open. This legislation included
nearly $7 million in funding for 10 community projects that will serve New York's 14th Congressional District.
The community projects include youth violence interventions, educational supports, workforce training in green jobs and home healthcare, and support for Plaza Del Sol Health Center and Elmhurst Hospital.

Biography
Representative Ritchie Torres is a fighter from the Bronx who has spent his entire life working for the community he calls home. Like many people in the Bronx, poverty and struggle have never been abstractions to him, and he governs from a place of lived experience.
RitchieÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs mother single-handedly raised him, his twin brother, and his sister in a public-housing project. She paid the bills working minimum-wage jobs, which in the 1990s paid $4.25 an hour. While Ritchie grew up with mold, lead, leaks, and no reliable heat or hot water in the winter, he watched the government spend over $100 million dollars to build a golf course across the street for Donald Trump. In 2013, at the age of 25, Ritchie became New York CityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs youngest elected official and the first openly L.G.B.T.Q. person elected to office in the Bronx.
At the City Council, Ritchie stood out, and during his seven-year tenure he tenaciously tackled problems big and small for the Bronx and New York City. He passed over forty pieces of legislation, including legislation protecting the CityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs affordable housing stock and tackling the cityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs opioid epidemic. As the Chairman overseeing NYCHA, he held the first committee hearing ever in public housing, which led to a $3 billion-dollar FEMA investment, the largest in NYC history. As Chair of the Oversight & Investigations Committee, Ritchie has led investigations into the heating outages and lead poisoning at NYCHA, the Taxi Medallion scandal, the CityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs controversial Third-Party Transfer prog

George Latimer (he/him/his), a third generation Westchester native, was born on Nov. 22, 1953 in Mount Vernon to the late Stanley and Loretta (Miner) Latimer. After attending Mount Vernon public schools, Latimer graduated with a B.A. from Fordham University in the Bronx in 1974, as well as a MasterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Degree in Public Administration from New York UniversityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Wagner School in 1976.
After completing his education Latimer first became a marketing executive, serving for more than 20 years at major corporate subsidiaries of Nestle, and ITT, with on-site responsibilities for projects with AT&T, IBM and Shearson Lehman. During that time Latimer gained first-hand business and economic experience, having direct involvement with project development at numerous sites nationwide.
A resident of the City of Rye for over 35 years, Latimer ran his first successful race for public office in 1987, earning him a seat on the Rye City Council. Four years later, in 1991, he was elected to the Westchester County Board of Legislators, where he became the first-ever Democra
---

t to win the 7th District seat representing the City of Rye, the Village of Larchmont, and Mamaroneck Town and Village. During the 13 years Latimer was a member of the chamber, he served as Minority Leader and then as the first Democratic Chairman of the Board of Legislators in Westchester County history.
From 1998 to 2001, while Latimer was Chairman of the Board, County property taxes decreased three consecutive years. Additionally, Latimer oversaw the passage of ground-breaking legislation such as the creation of the Human Rights Commission, Smoke Free Workplace Laws, and the Waste Haulers Laws. Latimer has always been regarded as bipartisan, transparent and accessible, appointing Republicans to chair committees, facilitating a fair redistricting plan involving members of the chamberÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs minority party and outside ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂgood governmentÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ groups, and establishing the first cable TV coverage of Board of Legislators meetings.
Elected in 2004 to the State Assembly, Latimer continued a solid record of accomplishment, sponsoring legislation and advancing funding for environmental issues including the protection of the Long Island Sound. During his tenure in the Assembly, Latimer authored more than 20 new laws. Latimer was then elected to the State Senate in November 2012, representing the 37th District comprised of 16 Westchester municipalities.
Over the years, Latimer has received public recognition and awards from numerous Westchester and Hudson Valley organizations for his work, including by the Sarah Neuman Center, the Washingtonville Housing Alliance, Congregation Anshe Sholom in New Rochelle, the Port Chester/Rye Brook Chamber of Commerce, the Mamaroneck Chamber of Commerce, LMC-TV, Council of Community Services in Port Chester-Rye Town, Helping Hands and the NY State Associa

tion of School Psychologists.
Latimer took office as Westchester County Executive in January 2018 as the ninth County Executive. He was then re-elected to a second term as County Executive in November 2021, never losing an election after over three decades in public office.
During his tenure as County Executive, Latimer has upheld an impressive record of achievements including three consecutive County property tax cuts and credit rating stabilization. He is also responsible for bringing several long-standing infrastructure projects to fruition, including the historic Elijah J. Miller House, Sprain Ridge Pool, New Rochelle Family Court and the North and South County Trailways. Latimer has broke-ground on Memorial Field in Mount Vernon, and unveiled the CountyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 9/11 First Responders Memorial on the 20thÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Anniversary of the September 11ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ attacks, dedicated to the heroes who passed away from 9/11 related illnesses.
Latimer has worked with all stakeholders on key social justice reforms, including the Police Reform and Reimagining Task Force, banning Gay Conversion Therapy, signing the Anti-Wage Theft Law and the Wage History Anti-Discrimination Law among others. He has worked to electrify the CountyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Bee-Line Bus Fleet, and modernize all County facilities for a green future. Today, Latimer continues to lead Westchester County through the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic as the County continues to rebound, rebuild and recover.
LatimerÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs sound business experience, his record of public service and his dedication to Westchester County have been the driving force behind his efforts for the last 35 years. Using inclusion and openness as a foreground, he is fighting to make Westchester County a destination for all people to live, work and enjoy.

Prior to his 2022 election to Congress, Ryan served the community that raised him as Ulster County Executive. There, Ryan led the County through the COVID-19 pandemic and spearheaded policies that delivered relief to working families while never raising taxes. He led the charge to revitalize the former IBM site, now known as iPark 87, helped put money back in small business owners and residentsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ pockets, took on corporate special interests, and delivered new investments in mental health services.

Image  
Josh Riley is from Endicott, New York, where his family spent generations working in the local factories, making shoes and boots at the Endicott-Johnson Shoe Corporation and circuit boards at IBM. When corrupt politicians and greedy corporations shipped those jobs overseas, Josh saw the American Dream slip away for many of his neighbors ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ so he dedicated his career to fighting for working-class neighborhoods like the one that raised him.  
Josh served as a policy analyst at the U.S. Department of Labor, focused on helping communities that had been sold out by bad trade deals. After law school, Josh represented children from low-income families in a landmark civil rights case to improve access to affordable healthcare. Josh went on to serve as counsel on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, where he took on big corporations that exploited workers and consumers and brought together Democrats and Republicans to expand addiction treatment programs and combat the opioid epidemic.  
In Congress, Josh is focused on giving working families a square deal in our economy and a voice in our politics. HeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs working to rebuild the Middle Class by ending bad trade deals and bringing good manufacturing jobs back home, lowering costs and cutting taxes, and protecting Social Security an

About  
Image  
U.S. Representative Nick LaLota (NY-01) was first sworn into office in January 2023.  
Nick learned the values of hard work and service to the community from his own family. It is that commitment to service which drives him as a Member of Congress.  
NickÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs father served as a Nassau County Police Officer, his grandfathers served in the NYPD, and his stepfather served in the Navy. NickÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs mother, while working at Grumman assigned to the F-14 program, brought home U.S. Navy Tomcat models.  Those models, and his familyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs longtime service to the community, had an impact on both Nick and his brother.  
NickÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs brother Dan is a retired Marine Sniper who earned a Bronze Star with Valor for his service in Fallujah, Iraq. Nick also went on to serve.  
While a senior at St. AnthonyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs High School, Nick applied to one of the few coveted spots at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis.  Selected for academic record and leadership, Nick attended and earned his degree from Annapolis. Nick entered the Navy and attained the rank of Lieutenant.  Serving our nation in uniform, Nick was sent overseas on three separate occasions, deploying to twenty countries.  
As a Surface Warfare Officer, Nick served as Assistant Operations Officer
---
on the USS Curts and as a Tactical Action Officer on USS Carl Vinson, a nuclear powered Aircraft Carrier.  For his service he was awarded a Joint Service Commendation Medal in support of the Global War on Terrorism.
After his Naval career protecting our nation, and with it Long Island, Nick returned home. He then went to work continuing his public service.  In 2013, Nick was appointed to the Amityville Board of Trustees and successfully ran for election in 2014 and re-election in 2015.
As a Trustee, Nick maintained a focus on reducing the tax burden on AmityvilleÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs families and businesses, while improving Village services and the viability of the VillageÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs downtown and beach. As the VillageÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Budget Officer, he helped craft four consecutive budgets that complied with the 2% property tax cap, without eliminating any Village services. In 2015 and 2016, following budgets providing significant surpluses, the Village received upgrades from MoodyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs and S&P credit rating agencies.
As the Chairman of the Committee to the Police Department, Nick increased the number of Officers on patrol.  As Chairman of the Committee to the Fire Department, Nick worked with the ChiefsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Office and Fire Council to start a Village Fire Marshal program, refurbish multiple ambulances, and increase EMT funding by 40% while appropriating additional funding for life saving equipment that kept our volunteer firefighters and community safe.
Since 2008, Nick has served in different leadership roles in local government on Long Island, most recently serving as Chief of Staff to the Suffolk County Legislature.  There, Nick worked with the Presiding Officer, County Legislators, staff and the public to deliver superior municipal services at affordable tax rates while protecting the environmentÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ especially surf

ace waters and drinking waters. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Nick oversaw Suffolk CountyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs $3.7 billion budget which services the countyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 1.5 million residents.
Prior to being the County LegislatureÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Chief of Staff, Nick served as Commissioner of the Suffolk County Board of Elections where he worked diligently to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat in our democratic process. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ When appointed, Nick became the youngest person to hold the post in three decades. Nick also served as Chief of Staff to a New York State Senator, where he learned how to ensure citizensÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ voices were heard as he directed legislation, government relations, strategy and community outreach.
A husband and father, Nick and his wife Kaylie, his high school sweetheart, are raising three daughters.
Nick is a cum laude graduate from Hofstra UniversityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Zarb School of Business with a Masters Degree in Business Administration (MBA). ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ In addition, Nick holds a Juris Doctor from Hofstra UniversityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Maurice A. Deane School of Law.
Nick continues his commitment to serving Long Island in the halls of Congress by fighting to lower taxes for working class Long Islanders, secure energy independence and defend all of our constitutional freedoms.

Congressman John W. Mannion represents New YorkÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 22nd Congressional District including the communities of Syracuse, Utica, Oneida, Auburn, and Cortland. He represents all of Onondaga and Madison Counties and parts of Oneida, Cayuga, and Cortland Counties.
A lifelong resident of Central New York, Congressman Mannion spent nearly three decades teaching high school science, including Advanced Placement Biology and Chemistry. As the West Genesee TeachersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Association president for eight years, he represented 400 teachers and nurses during two successful contract negotiations. The congressman is a graduate of the SUNY System, attending Binghamton and Oswego.
As a New York State Senator, Mannion served as the founding Chairman of the Senate Committee on Disabilities. He secured four consecutive cost of living increases for Direct Support Professionals and expanded the preferred source program to boost employment opportunities for individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities. He also authored legislation requiring a report by New York StateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Office for Persons with Developmental Disabilities on the agencyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs pand

emic response, and he prioritized solutions to address critical workforce and housing shortages.
In the State Senate, Mannion championed efforts to bring new jobs to Central New York, fighting to pass the historic Green Chips legislation that provides low-cost power to the computer chip industry in New York. Micron has pointed to this meaningful legislation as a determining factor in its decision to invest $100B in MannionÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs district to build a Chip Fab in Clay, NY. Mannion also passed bills to create the Upstate Flood Mitigation Task Force and establish the first new police force in the state in fifty years at the Syracuse Regional Airport Authority. Throughout his time in Albany, he secured over $5 million for critical workforce development programs and passed into law some of the strongest reproductive health care protections in the country.
Congressman Mannion is a lifelong Central New Yorker and the grandchild of Irish immigrants. His mother worked at New York Telephone and his father for New York Central Railroad, raising John on Syracuse's famous Tipperary Hill. He now resides in Geddes with his wife of twenty-seven years, Jennifer. She has worked for over twenty-five years as an elementary teacher and reading interventionist, while raising their three children.

Congressman Nick Langworthy was elected to represent Western New York and the Southern Tier in Congress in 2022. New York's 23rd Congressional District includes Chautauqua, Allegany, Cattaraugus, and Tioga Counties, and parts of Erie, Schuyler, and Steuben Counties. He currently serves as a member of the House Rules, Energy and Commerce, and Oversight Committees, fighting to ensure that his constituents and our rural communities have a seat at the table on major legislation.
With a background rooted in public service, Langworthy began his career working in the district office of former Congressman Tom Reynolds, where he developed and led a strong constituent services team. He recently served as the Chairman of the New York Republican State Committee, championing Upstate New York and ensuring their voices are heard in state politics. As a member of Congress, Langworthy prioritizes constituent service, casework, and cutting red tape for his constituents while bringing home important resources for the communities in his district, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂNo problem is too big, and no problem is too small.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
Congressman Langworthy is the Chairman of the Aviation Safety Caucus and was a lead
---
er during the consideration of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, to uphold airline safety measures established after the Colgan Air Flight 3407 tragedy in Clarence, NY. He is also co-chair of the Maple Caucus and an active member of the Northern Border Security Caucus, the Rural Health Caucus, and other groups.
LangworthyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs dedication to public service is reflected in his commitment to promoting jobs and economic opportunity for Western New York and the Southern Tier and protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans. His work in Congress is driven by his upbringing ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ working in his familyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs bar and restaurant business ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and his deep-seated belief in the small-town values of hard work, perseverance, and self-determination.
Born in Jamestown, NY, and a proud alumnus of Pine Valley Central School, Langworthy has the honor to represent the communities where he was raised and where he worked his entire life. Congressman Langworthy and his wife, Erin, currently reside in Pendleton, NY, where they are raising their son and daughter. He remains deeply connected to his community, striving to represent their interests and uphold their values in Washington, D.C.

Congressman Gregory W. Meeks
Biography
From public housing to the nation's Capital, Gregory Weldon Meeks has lived a true American success story. Known for his compassionate and tenacious representation of his constituents, and his coalition-building skills, Meeks proudly serves the constituents of New York's Fifth Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Early Life
Congressman Meeks' compassion and ability to collaborate are rooted in his upbringing. His family ventured north during the Great Migration from Rock Hill, South Carolina, eventually settling in East Harlem. He grew up in a public housing project and knew in his early years that he wanted to be a lawyer. He was inspired by a mother and father who worked hard to ensure that their children would have opportunities for advancement that they never did. Meeks' parents passed on to him a profound sense of social justice, commitment to community, and willingness to extend a helping hand to those in need.
He carried these values with him to Adelphi University where he earned a bachelo

r's degree in history. At Howard University Law School, Meeks embraced the jurisprudence of his idol, Thurgood Marshall, and of Charles Hamilton Houston. In the years to follow, Congressman Meeks worked as a Queens County Assistant District Attorney, a prosecutor for a special anti-narcotics taskforce, and chief administrative judge for New York State's worker compensation system. In 1992, he was elected to the New York State Assembly, where he served until 1998, when he won a special election to represent the Fifth Congressional District of New York.
Work in Congress
Congressman Gregory W. Meeks, now in his thirteenth term, has devoted his energy and skill to serving one of the most diverse constituencies in the nation. His efforts on behalf of his district, New York City and State, and the nation as a whole have earned Rep. Meeks the respect of his constituents, New Yorkers, and Democrats and Republicans alike. He is known for being an effective, principled, and common sense leader. As a fervent supporter of the Affordable Care Act enacted under President Obama, Congressman Meeks believes that it should be enhanced. Congressman Meeks is part of the forward-thinking, pro-growth Democratic members who comprise the New Democrat Coalition (NDC), the largest ideological caucus in Congress. He co-chairs the NDCC Trade Task Force.
Congressman Meeks is the Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He formerly served as the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Rep. Meeks was the first Black Member of Congress to serve as Chair of that committee in the 117th Congress. Meeks is a multilateralist with decades of experience in foreign policy. He believes that the United States should build coalitions around our interests and work with other countries to bu

ild a stable and prosperous future.
He is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, where he served as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions which oversees all financial regulators such as, FDIC, Federal Reserve and all matters pertaining to consumer credit and the stability of the banking system. Rep. Meeks previously served as a Dodd-Frank conferee. Key provisions in the Wall Street reform law ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ including its stress testing requirement, the creation of the Office of Minority and Women Inclusion at the financial regulatory agencies, and the requirement that U.S. public companies who use natural resources to report their due diligence in stamping out conflict mineralsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ were co-authored by Congressman Meeks and remain in the law today. Rep. Meeks introduced a bill that would require government contractors and public companies to submit data on the racial, ethnic, and gender composition of their corporate boards.

District Work
Congressman Meeks is focused on revitalizing the economy, creating jobs, and enhancing the resiliency of the Fifth District's transportation, housing and environmental infrastructure, which were hit hard by Superstorm Sandy
.
Throughout his tenure in Congress, Congressman Meeks has fought to make New York City accessible and full of opportunity for all New Yorkers. One result of Representative Meeks' tireless efforts came to fruition in April of 2017, at the groundbreaking ceremony of the Crossing at Jamaica Station. The housing and retail project, which will bring approximately 4,000 construction jobs to Jamaica, includes hundreds of new affordable residential units. To make this crucial economic dev

elopment possible, Congressman Meeks secured $21 million in federal tax credits.
Ever striving to improve NYC's accessibility, Congressman Meeks strengthened the major regional transportation hub in Jamaica, Queens via the Intermodal Enhancement and Atlantic Avenue ExtensionÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwhich includes parts of the LIRR and NYC subway system, Airtrain connection to JFK Airport, and a total of 31 bus lines. He secured over $6 million and $10 million through the Federal Transit Administration and Federal Highway Administration respectively, to vastly improve transportation in his district, especially to and from JFK airport. Congressman Meeks also worked with Governor Cuomo to provide a significant $10 billion upgrade to JFK Airport. Ever focused on increasing diversity, Congressman Meeks advocated for Minority and Women Business Enterprises (MWBEs) in the bidding process.
Increasing diversity in all sectors of the economy is important to Congressman Meeks and in 1999 he secured $250,000 in federal funding to initiate the Science Engineering Mathematics and Aerospace Academy (SEMAA) at CUNY's York College. The SEMAA program continues to educate and inspire young students to this day.
Not only has Congressman Meeks worked to build up Jamaica, but he has been keen on building up Far Rockaway, too. To this end, Congressman Meeks collaborated on the monumental Roadmap for Action, introduced in 2016, which will provide $91 million for the revitalization of Downtown Far Rockaway. These funds marked the continuation of Meeks' ongoing effort to increase affordable housing options, improve transportation infrastructure, and boost the local economy.
Additionally, in the spring of 2017, Congressman Meeks and New York City launched a new ferry service, ""NYC Ferry,"" in the Rockaways a month ahead

of schedule. This critical project had been in the works since 2005, when Representative Meeks procured $15 million in federal funding.
For years, Congressman Meeks has introduced a bill to allow for fairness in the recoupment of disaster assistance, to help not only his district rebuild after Superstorm Sandy, but also other districts suffering from natural disasters.
Personal Life
Congressman Meeks is a member of the Allen AME Church in St. Albans, New York and a proud member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. As a huge sports fan, Meeks enjoys watching the New York Knicks, the New York Giants, and the New York Mets.
He is married to Simone-Marie Meeks. He has three daughters ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Ebony, Aja, and Nia-Aiyana and four granddaughters.

CONGRESSMAN HAKEEM JEFFRIES
Hakeem Jeffries represents the diverse Eighth Congressional District of New York and is serving his seventh term in the United States Congress.
Rep. Jeffries is the Democratic Leader, having been unanimously elected to that position by his colleagues in November 2022. In that capacity, he is the highest-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives. He is also the former Chair of the Democratic Caucus, Whip of the Congressional Black Caucus and previously co-chaired the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee where he helped develop the For The People agenda.
In Congress, Rep. Jeffries is a tireless advocate for social and economic justice. He has worked hard to help residents recover from the devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic, reform our criminal justice system, improve the economy for everyday Americans and protect our healthcare from right-wing attacks.
Rep. Jeffries has been instrumental in House Democratic efforts to put people over politics by lowering costs, creating better-paying jobs and fighting for safer communities. During the Biden presidency, Democrats passed the American Rescue Plan, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.
Over the last four years, Rep. Jeffries has secured more than $56 million for projects in Brooklyn to provide food for the hungry, fund overdue improvements to medical centers, support organizations

 working to uplift our neighborhoods, deepen our cultural understanding and more through the Community Project Funding process. In the spring of 2022, he successfully fought against the splitting of Bedford Stuyvesant into multiple Congressional Districts during the broken and gravely flawed redistricting process unleashed by partisan Republicans and their judicial co-conspirators in New York.
During the 117th Congress, Rep. Jeffries was one of the most effective legislators, passing multiple bills through the House of Representatives and into law with substantial bipartisan and stakeholder support. These measures touched on diverse subject matters and were drafted with the intention of making meaningful improvements to our federal laws and programs. Such bills included measures to ensure veterans and their families have access to benefits information (H.R. 2093, Public Law No. 117-62), to measure the progress of recovery and efforts to address corruption, rule of law and media freedoms in Haiti (H.R. 2471, Public Law No. 117-103), to protect attorney-client privilege for incarcerated individuals corresponding electronically with their legal representatives (H.R. 546) and to eliminate the federal sentencing disparity between drug offenses involving crack cocaine and powder cocaine once and for all (H.R. 1693).
In the 116th Congress, Rep. Jeffries was similarly active in the legislative process, with many of his bills passing the House of Representatives and becoming law. They included bills to create a copyright small claims board allowing the creative middle class to protect their works (H.R. 2426, Public Law No. 116-260), to expand scholarship opportunities available to Pakistani women (H.R. 4508, Public Law No. 116-338) and to provide entrepreneurship counseling and 
---
training services to formerly incarcerated individuals (H.R. 5065).  
In January 2020, Rep. Jeffries was selected by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to serve as one of seven House Impeachment Managers in the Senate trial of President Donald Trump, becoming the first African American man to serve in that role. During the nearly three-week trial, Congressman Jeffries argued that President Trump should be removed from office for abusing his power by pressuring a foreign government, Ukraine, to target an American citizen as part of a corrupt scheme to interfere in the 2020 election. The House Impeachment Managers established with a mountain of evidence that crimes against the Constitution were committed. Nevertheless, the Senate failed to remove the President without hearing from a single witness during the trial.  
On March 9, 2021, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1280, the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂGeorge Floyd Justice in Policing ActÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ for the second time through the House. During both pushes, Rep. Jeffries helped lead the charge with respect to passage of this historic police reform bill, which included legislation authored by the Congressman to criminalize the chokehold and other inherently dangerous tactics such as a knee to the neck. Rep. Jeffries remains dedicated to working with his colleagues to make transformational police reform a reality and breathe life into the principle of liberty and justice for all.  
Rep. Jeffries played a major role in shaping the Congressional response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He fought hard to assist state and local governments whose budgets were devastated by the virus, pushed for an extension of the emergency unemployment benefit and supported efforts to keep everyday Americans in their homes. Rep. Jeffries also worked across the aisle with Rep. Peter King (R-NY) to
---
 secure billions of dollars in funding for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in the CARES Act (H.R. 748, Public Law No. 116-136), which became law in March 2020. At home, Rep. Jeffries partnered with the Governor to expand testing in hard-hit communities of color by establishing walk-in sites at houses of worship throughout New York City. He denounced discriminatory social distance policing that targeted communities of color and helped bring about a change in policy.
In the 115th Congress, Rep. Jeffries worked across the aisle as the lead Democratic sponsor of the FIRST STEP Act (S. 756, Public Law No. 115-391), a strong, bipartisan criminal justice reform bill that the President signed into law in December 2018. Rep. Jeffries partnered with Congressman Doug Collins, a conservative Republican from rural Georgia, on the legislation, which is widely viewed as the most meaningful criminal justice reform effort in a generation.
The FIRST STEP Act provided retroactive relief for the shameful crack cocaine sentencing disparity that unfairly destroyed lives, families and communities. The law shortens sentences by ensuring inmates can earn 54 days of good time credit per year and authorized $375 million over five years to expand re-entry programming, including education and vocational training, which is proven to dramatically reduce recidivism and help prepare for a successful transition back into society. In order to strengthen and preserve family relationships, the bill requires the Bureau of Prisons to house incarcerated individuals within 500 driving miles of their relatives and permits the transfer of lower-risk inmates to home confinement. In addition, the FIRST STEP Act bans the immoral practice of shackling women throughout the duration of their pregnancy, durin

Rep. Jeffries also played a key role in the House passage of the historic Music Modernization Act (MMA) (H.R. 5447, Public Law No. 115-264), which became law in 2018. Heralded as a sweeping update to our copyright laws, the MMA will improve the licensing process so that songwriters, artists and musicians can continue to share their creativity with the world. Because of the MMA, songwriters are more likely to get paid a fair price for their work, and digital music providers like Spotify and Pandora will be able to operate more efficiently. In an era of crisis and dysfunction in Washington, the power of music brought Democrats and Republicans in Congress together to collaborate on groundbreaking legislation, ushering our music copyright system into the 21st Century.
In April of 2018, the President signed the Rep. Jeffries-authored Keep AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Refuges Operational Act (H.R. 3979, Public Law No. 115-1689) into law. Each year, 47 million Americans visit wildlife refuges, generating almost $2 billion in local economic activity. This law will keep AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs refuges operational by supporting the volunteers who dedicate thousands of hours to maintain our public lands. Passage of this bill was part of a bipartisan, bicameral effort to ensure Americans can visit, explore and study wildlife and experience our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs vast natural beauty for generations to come.
Several other pieces of Rep. Jeffries-authored legislation passed the House of Representatives in the 115th Congress, including bills to investigate the public health impact of synthetic drug use by teenagers (H.R. 449, Public Law No. 115-271) and updating federal regulations to remove racially offensive terminology from use (H.R. 995). Rep. JeffriesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ H.R. 3229 (Public Law No.

 95-521), which helps protect judicial officers from threats, harm and harassment by those who would seek to compromise the integrity of our judicial branch, also passed the House in 2017 and was signed into law in March 2018. Additionally, Rep. Jeffries authored H.R. 3370 (Public Law No. 95-921), the Fry Scholarship Enhancement Act, which became law as part of the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017. It expands the availability of education benefits to the children and spouses of service members killed in the line of duty.
In the 114th Congress, Rep. Jeffries teamed up with Congressman Peter King to pass the Slain Officer Family Support Act of 2015 (H.R. 1508, Public Law No. 113-227), which President Obama signed into law. That law extended the tax deadline so that individuals making charitable donations to organizations supporting the families of assassinated New York Police Department (NYPD) Detectives Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, could apply such tax deductions to the prior yearÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs tax return.
In the 113th Congress, Rep. Jeffries successfully passed H.R. 5108 (Public Law No. 113-227), legislation that established the Law School Clinic Certification Program of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) into law. This program had been operating in a pilot capacity since 2008 and enabled students at participating law schools to gain experience in patent and trademark law while providing legal assistance to inventors, tech entrepreneurs and small businesses. The bipartisan bill, which was signed by President Obama, expanded the program by removing its ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂpilotÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ status, making it available to all accredited law schools in the country that meet the programÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs eligibility requirements.

 of a number of other key pieces of legislation, including the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 (H.R. 152), a bill that provides billions of dollars in Superstorm Sandy recovery to the Eighth District and other affected areas. The Congressman also sponsored ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and passed as part of the National Defense Authorization package ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the Prison Ship MartyrsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Monument Preservation Act, which directs the U.S. Secretary of the Interior to study the feasibility of designating the Prison Ship MartyrsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ mausoleum in Brooklyn as a national monument. Consisting of a 100-foot-wide granite staircase and a central Doric column 149 feet in height, the monument in Fort Greene Park houses the remains of 11,500 Revolutionary War soldiers who were kept as prisoners of war by the British.
While he remains committed to working diligently in Washington on behalf of New YorkÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Eighth Congressional District, Rep. Jeffries also works tirelessly to keep in close contact with constituents. The Congressman begins each year with annual remarks to the district. During the spring and summer, he holds ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂCongress on Your CornerÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ outdoor office hours throughout the district. At each stop, the Congressman sets up a table in front of a local post office or on neighborhood corners where constituents are able to meet with him one-on-one. He also hosts regularly-scheduled telephone town hall meetings that provide an opportunity for constituents to speak directly with the Congressman about local and national issues.
Prior to his election to the Congress, Rep. Jeffries served for six years in the New York State Assembly. In that capacity, he authored laws to protect the civil liberties of law-abiding New Yorkers during police encounters, encourage the transformation of vacant luxury condominiums into afforda

ble homes for working families and improve the quality of justice in the civil court system.
In 2010, Rep. Jeffries successfully led the first meaningful legislative reform of the NYPDÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs aggressive and controversial stop-and-frisk program. His legislation prohibits the NYPD from maintaining an electronic database with the personal information of individuals who were stopped, questioned and frisked during a police encounter but not charged with a crime or violation.
In the same year, Rep. Jeffries sponsored and championed groundbreaking civil rights legislation to end prison-based gerrymandering in New York State. This archaic practice of counting incarcerated individuals at the location of their imprisonment, rather than their homes, undermined the fundamental democratic principle of one person, one vote. After passage of JeffriesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ legislation, New York became the second state to count incarcerated individuals in their home districts in census calculations.
Congressman Jeffries obtained his bachelorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree in political science from the State University of New York at Binghamton, where he graduated with honors for outstanding academic achievement. He then received his masterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree in public policy from Georgetown University. Thereafter, Rep. Jeffries attended New York University School of Law, where he graduated magna cum laude and served on Law Review.
After completing law school, Rep. Jeffries clerked for the Honorable Harold Baer Jr. of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. He then practiced law for several years at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, an internationally renowned law firm and served as counsel in the litigation department of Viacom Inc. and CBS. He also worked as of-counsel at Godosky & Gentile, a well-r

Congressman Pat Harrigan brings a lifetime of service, leadership, and innovation to the U.S. House of Representatives. A combat-decorated Green Beret and a successful entrepreneur, Congressman Harrigan has dedicated his career to tackling challengesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂon the battlefield, in business, and now in Congress.
After graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point with a degree in Nuclear Engineering, Congressman Harrigan commissioned as an Infantry officer and was stationed at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. He deployed to Afghanistan as a young Platoon Leader, commanding a remote combat outpost in the heart of the Arghandab Valley. At just 23 years old, Congressman Harrigan managed over 350 personnel and $100 million in infrastructure and equipment, gaining invaluable experience in high-pressure leadership.
Recognizing the need for even greater expertise in unconventional warfare, Congressman Harrigan volunteered for and earned the Green Beret. As a member of the U.S. Army Special Forces, he returned to Afghanistan to lead operati

ons in increasingly complex and volatile environments. For his service, he was awarded two Bronze Stars in recognition of his leadership and effectiveness in combat. These experiences shaped his understanding of the critical connection between accountability, mission success, and guiding teams under pressure.
While serving in the military, Congressman Harrigan and his wife Rocky launched a small firearms business out of their home. Rooted in North Carolinian values of hard work and ingenuity, the company grew rapidly. What began in their living room quickly scaled into a thriving enterprise, producing American-made defense products that support national security. Today, the company operates out of a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Western North Carolina, creating jobs and fostering innovation for the region.
The fall of Afghanistan marked a turning point for Congressman Harrigan. Watching the consequences of failed leadership unfold, he knew he had to act. Motivated by his dedication to his country and a desire to restore strength and accountability to Washington, Congressman Harrigan stepped forward to serve in Congress.
Now, as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Congressman Harrigan applies the same principles that guided him in the Army and in business: bold leadership, unshakable integrity, and a commitment to delivering results.
Congressman Harrigan and his wife Rocky have been married for 13 years and are the proud parents of two daughters, Reagan and McKinley. As North CarolinaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs voice in Congress, Pat is dedicated to serving the hardworking families and communities of the Tenth District.

A Hendersonville businessman and civic leader, Chuck previously served three terms in the North Carolina Senate beginning in 2016. There, he gained a reputation as a workhorse, serving on 18 committees ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ chairing eight of them ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and focusing on improving the lives of those in his district and for all North Carolinians.

She was sworn into the House of Representatives on January 3, 2025, for her third term representing North CarolinaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Second Congressional District, which includes most of Wake County.
In Congress, Deborah is fighting for equality, justice, and progress. She serves on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Committee on Space, Science, and Technology. She is also a member of House DemocratsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ leadership

team, serving as a Chief Deputy Whip and on the Steering and Policy Committee.
In her first two terms, Deborah became a leading voice on issues ranging from womenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs health and health care access to immigration reform and clean energy technology. Since taking office, 13 pieces of DeborahÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs legislation have been signed into law, including bills to increase funding for sexual assault nurse examiners, hold perpetrators of child sexual abuse accountable, enhance judicial ethics and transparency, and bolster North CarolinaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs offshore wind energy potential. She also secured crucial federal funding for affordable housing, public safety, and water systems throughout Wake County.
This Congress, Deborah continues to fight for legislation to advance real solutions for North Carolinians and people across the country. She is the lead sponsor of comprehensive legislation to help end sexual abuse and violence in sports by strengthening the U.S. Center for SafeSport. She is also spearheading critical legislation to protect legal immigration options that are under attack by the Trump administration. She proudly introduced a bill to protect Documented Dreamers, the children of long-term visa holders who come to the United States legally and live in many North Carolina communities.
Deborah grew up in a small town. The proud daughter of an Air Force veteran and an early childhood education teacher, her parents instilled in her the belief that with opportunity comes responsibility and that through public service she could help others and make a difference.
She graduated from law school at UNC-Chapel Hill and entered public service in 2002, when she ran for and won a seat representing Wake County in the North Carolina House of Representatives, where she went on to serve for more than a decade

Here is the extracted text exactly as it is:

---
. As a Representative in the General Assembly, Deborah worked to protect voting rights, fund transit and transportation projects, increase access to affordable housing, and protect and expand healthcare. Deborah was named as one of Wake County's most effective legislators for her ability to work across the aisle to deliver results for the people of North Carolina.
Prior to serving in public office, Deborah worked as a civil rights lawyer, helping to pass the SouthÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first anti-racial profiling law and reforms to the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs juvenile justice laws. Later, in private practice, she worked to build North CarolinaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs clean energy future, helping to create thousands of jobs in the renewable energy sector.

Early Years
In the heart of Chapel Hill, Valerie FousheeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs early years were marked by transitions and resilience. Her parents, Annie and Melvin Paige, were teenagers when she was born and were forced to drop out of high school to raise her and her five younger siblings. Growing up, she watched her parents work two and three jobs to make ends meet, but they always instilled in their children the importance of hard work, education, and community ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ values that still shape Valerie today.
Valerie began her ed
---
ucation at Northside Elementary School, but her family soon moved to the Pine Knolls neighborhood, where she attended Frank Porter Graham Elementary School, the only option available for Black children at that time. It was not until the sixth grade, more than a decade after Brown vs. Board of Education, that Valerie experienced an integrated education at Lincoln Middle School.
ValerieÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs leadership and public service potential shone early on. At Culbreth Junior High School, she was elected as the Ninth Grade Class President and later as the Senior Class President at Chapel Hill High School. Additionally, she began volunteering at Head Start where she volunteered for multiple summers starting at the age of 11. Her passion for leadership and service was nurtured at First Baptist Church, where she honed the skills crucial for a future in politics. She recalls, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂYou have to have a message, just like in politics. You have to be able to identify a base for any position that you get in the churchÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ. It was also there that she learned parliamentary procedure and public speaking.
Higher Education and Personal Milestones
ValerieÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs dream of attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill came true after high school. The campus provided her a new perspective on her hometown. However, after two years, she was forced to withdraw because she could not afford to continue. Valerie went on to marry her high school sweetheart, Stanely Foushee, and had two sons, Stanley II and Terrence.
Stepping into Public Service
In 1987, after the birth of her second son, Valerie joined the Chapel Hill Police Department as an administrative officer. Despite working twelve-hour shifts, she remained deeply involved in her childrenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs education and would volunteer in their classrooms. While voluntee

ring, she observed firsthand the persistent inequalities in the school system and decided to join the School Governance Council, which eventually inspired her to run for a seat on the Chapel Hill-Carrboro Schools Board. Valerie won and served from 1997 to 2004, advocating for equitable education.
Breaking New Ground
ValerieÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs public service journey continued in 2004 when she was elected to the Orange County Board of Commissioners and became the first African American woman to chair the county commission. During her time serving as a County Commissioner, she helped build schools, shut down landfills in historically marginalized communities, and funded community centers.
After 21 years of service, she retired from the Chapel Hill Police Department in 2008, and that same year, she graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a degree in Political Science and African and Afro-American Studies.
Serving in the North Carolina General Assembly
In 2012, Valerie was elected to serve in the North Carolina General Assembly first as a State Representative for North CarolinaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 50

District. During her tenure in the General Assembly, Valerie championed legislation for women, people of color, voting rights, and environmental protection. Her efforts included fighting for clean water, mitigating PFAS pollution, safeguarding children from environmental hazards, and modernizing the voter registration process.
Serving in U.S. Congress
After serving as a State Senator for nearly ten years, Valerie announced her campaign to represent North CarolinaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Fourth District in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2021.

Congresswoman Virginia Foxx represents North CarolinaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 5th District in the United States House of Representatives. Throughout her time in Congress, Foxx has established herself as a champion of conservative values and has helped lead the national movements to reduce federal government spending and increase government oversight and accountability.
She currently serves as the Chairwoman of the House Committee on Rules and previously served as the Chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. From 2013 to 2016, she served as Secretary of the House Republican Conference.
The nonpartisan magazine National Journal has consistently ranked Foxx as one of the most conservative members of the North Carolina Congressional Delegation. She also has a lifetime 96 percent approval rating from the American Conservative Union.
Representative Foxx is a visible
leader
in the 
---
---
House Republican Conference, where she regularly takes a stand for the principles of individual freedom and limited government. She was also the first member of her 2004 class to introduce and pass a substantive bill in the House.
In 2008 Foxx successfully passed a bill to streamline the federal government and save taxpayer money.  This accomplishment makes her one of the few members of Congress who took office in 2004 who got legislation signed into law in both the 109th and 110th Congresses.
As the Chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Higher Education, Foxx led efforts to modernize and reform the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs workforce development system. In 2014, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), which provided a long overdue reform of the Workforce Investment Act, was signed into law. WIOA, a bipartisan, bicameral compromise between the Foxx-authored SKILLS Act (H.R. 803) and the Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356), streamlines and improves existing federal workforce development programs and fosters a modern workforce that American businesses can rely on to compete.
Prior to serving on Capitol Hill, Foxx spent 10 years in the North Carolina Senate where she successfully sponsored several statewide and local bills and consistently voted against tax increases and for legislation that would make governments more efficient and less wasteful.
Dr. Foxx is a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where she received her A.B. degree in English and M.A.C.T. in Sociology.  She earned her Ed.D. in Curriculum and Teaching/Higher Education from UNC-Greensboro.
Dr. Foxx began her career as a secretary and research assistant at UNC-Chapel Hill.  She taught at Caldwell Community College, was a sociology instructor at Appalachian State University and held
---
several administrative positions at ASU, including Assistant Dean of the General College.  Dr. Foxx also served as Deputy Secretary for Management in the N.C. Department of Administration for Governor Jim Martin. Prior to her election to the Senate in 1994, she served as President and later a consultant at Mayland Community College from 1987-1994.
Representative Foxx has been active in civic and business affairs, serving on many state and national committees.  She served on the Executive Committee of North Carolina Citizens for Business and Industry and was elected to three four-year terms on the Watauga County Board of Education.  She was confirmed by the United States Senate for a Presidential appointment to the National Advisory Council for Women's Educational Programs.  She also served on the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation Advisory Panel. Other current or former service on boards includes the Board of Directors of the John William Pope Center for Higher Education Policy, Board of Directors of the N.C. Center for Public Research, the UNC-Chapel Hill Board of Visitors, National Conference of State Legislatures' Blue Ribbon Advisory Panel on Child Care, Charter Member of the Mount Airy Museum of Regional History and the Foscoe-Grandfather Community Center Board.
Dr. Foxx is a member of the American Legion Auxiliary, the worldÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs largest womenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs patriotic service organization.  Her support for AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs veterans and active-duty military is characterized by her introduction of the HERO Act, legislation that extends IRA benefits for troops serving in combat zones.  She has also supported bills that expand veteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ disability compensation and that significantly increased overall Veterans Affairs funding.  Dr. Foxx has also voted in favor of honoring our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs fallen by p

Dr. Foxx is the recipient of several state and national awards.  Among those awards are the U.S. Chamber of CommerceÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Spirit of Enterprise Award, the Family Research CouncilÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs True Blue Award and the Alan Keith-Lucas Friend of Children Award, the highest honor granted by the North Carolina Child Care Association.  She is a former Rotarian.
At Mayland Community College, Dr. Foxx implemented several nationally recognized programs including a curriculum evaluation program which has been adopted by major universities.

Congressman Mark Harris represents the people of North CarolinaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 8th Congressional District. He wants to be a voice for North Carolina families, not just a vote. He is dedicated to fighting for our values and freedoms and against government overreach.
A native North Carolinian, Mark brings a lifetime of serving others to the U.S. House of Representatives. Mark served as the senior pastor of First Baptist Church in Charlotte for over a decade, navigating multiple economic downturns and challenges. He has experienced firsthand the many ways that the government can impact peopleÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs lives, for better and for worse. But MarkÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs leadership goes beyond the pulpit. Mark served as president of the North Carolina Baptist Convention, where he was a key leader in passing North CarolinaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Marriage Amendment ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ which defined marriage as between one man and one woman.
Mark is married to his college sweetheart, Beth. They have three adult children and ten grandchildren. Mark graduated from Appalachian State University with a Bachelor of Science in Political Science. He went on to receive a Master of Divinity and a Doctor of Ministry from Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. In Congress, Mark expects to be appointed to the House Agriculture and Judiciary Commit

In that role, she helped deliver North Dakota families and businesses the lowest utilities services costs in the nation, permitted more than $15 billion in energy infrastructure projects, and advocated for reliability-based market reforms as her stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs liaison to the 15-state grid operator MISO (Midcontinent Independent System Operator).

Julie has been a national advocate for the responsible, aggressive energy development that is necessary for economic growth, public safety and national security.
Prior to being a utility regulator, Julie was U.S. Senator John HoevenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs state director for two years. Early in her career she served as communications director for North Dakota Governor

She later founded a successful communications business which she ran for 10 years, authoring several books and articles, and working with clients across business, government, and politics.
Born in Williston, raised in Fargo, and a graduate of Bismarck Century High School and the University of North Dakota, Julie embodies North DakotaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs hardworking and resilient spirit. Growing up as the youngest of eight children, she spent summers on her family farm near Belden, where she developed a deep appreciation for North DakotaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs farming and ranching communities.
Julie and her husband, Mike, a Navy veteran, have been married for 25 years, live in Mandan and have three grown children. They are active members of the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit parish and are involved in various community organizations, including the University of Mary, where Julie serves on the Board of Trustees.
In her free time, Julie enjoys entertaining, golfing, hunting, traveling, and cheering on North DakotaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs sports teams. Above all, she remains passionate about serving the people of North Dakota and preserving the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs values for future generations.

Growing up, Congressman Turner attended Dayton Public Schools and graduated from Belmont High School. He continued his education in Ohio and received a bachelorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree from Ohio Northern University, an MBA from the University of Dayton, and a Juris Doctorate from Case Weste

Congressman Turner practiced law in Dayton for over 17 years, and in 1991, he opened his own private legal practice specializing in real estate and corporate law.
Turner served as Mayor of the City of Dayton for eight years. During his tenure, he was a strong proponent of neighborhood revitalization and economic development. He created Rehabarama, a private-public partnership to rehabilitate neglected housing in DaytonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs historic neighborhoods, which had a significant economic impact on the region and received national awards. He also improved police response time by 40 percent, added 54 police officers to the force, and established a development fund that awarded over $19 million in grants for housing and job-producing projects, all while maintaining a balanced budget throughout his tenure.
Congressman Turner was first elected to Congress in 2002.

The subcommittees oversee Army and Air Force acquisition programs, all Navy and Marine Corps aviation programs, nuclear weapons, missile defense, and space systems.
At the time of Congressman Turner's election, there was no advocate for Wright-Patterson Air Force Base or OhioÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs military installations on the House Armed Services Committee. Congressman Turner filled that void and throughout his time in Congress, Wright-Patt has successfully doubled, adding approximately 19,000 jobs on-base. It remains the largest single-site employer in the st

Turner helped secure $182 million in federal funding for the construction of a new National Air and Space Intelligence Center, the Air ForceÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs primary source for foreign air and space threat analysis.
Turner served as Chairman of the
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence
(HPSCI) from 2023 to 2025. Turner was DaytonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first elected official to serve in a leadership role on a national security committee in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Most recently, Congressman Turner was selected to sit on the
Oversight and Accountability Committee
. The Oversight Committee seeks to ensure the efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of the federal government and all its agencies.
In January 2011, Turner was appointed Chairman of the US Delegation to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Parliamentary Assembly, the inter-parliamentary organization of legislators from the countries of the North Atlantic Alliance. In December of 2014, Turner was elected President of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. He now serves as Vice-Chairman of the Defense and Security Committee of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.

About Dave
Biography
A lifelong Ohioan, Dave has dedicated his life to family and public service. After graduating with his Juris Doctorate from the University of Dayton, Dave worked as a public defender before being elected as Geauga County Prosecutor in 1988 ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a position in which he served his community for nearly 25 years.
In November of 2012, Dave was elected to represent the 14th Congressional District of Ohio in the U.S. House of Representatives and is currently in his sixth term. He considers it a great honor to represent the people of Northeast Ohio and serve the communities where he was born and raised.
Since coming to Congress, Dave has established himself as a fierce advocate of the Great Lakes, successfully securing critical funding each year for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) to protect the environmental and economic health of the Great Lakes region.
As a former prosecutor, the safety and wellbeing of OhioÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs communities remain one of DaveÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs top priorities. He co-founded the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence in the 115th Congress and is the Vice Chair of the Addiction, Treatment and Recovery Caucus. With Ohio being one of the states hit hardest by the opioid epidemic, Dave fights to ensure that the federal funding Congress provides to combat addiction effectively supports the lifesaving work local communities carry out on the front lines of this crisis.
Dave serves on the influential House Committee on Appropriations, which is responsible for scrutinizing federal spending and determining how your tax dollars are spent. In this role, he works to restore fiscal responsibility, which he believes is needed to create a stronger, more prosp

erous nation for the next generation. In keeping with a tradition he established while serving as Geauga County Prosecutor, Dave has returned more than $1.5 million from his personal Congressional budget to the U.S. Treasury since 2013.
Following in the footsteps of his predecessor in Congress, Steve LaTourette, Dave is proud to put policy over politics and work across the aisle to find solutions to the challenges facing the lives and livelihoods of Northeast Ohio families.
In the 118th Congress, Dave served as
Chairman of the Republican Governance Group
, a group of Republican lawmakers from across the country comprised of pragmatic members who are committed to productive and effective governance. Members carefully consider policy stances and aim to make a difference rather than pushing partisan noise.
In the first session of the 118
th
Congress, Dave was once again recognized as one of the most effective and bipartisan lawmakers in Washington by the
Lugar Center
and Georgetown UniversityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs McCourt School of Public Policy.
Dave resides in Bainbridge Township, Ohio, with his wife (and fellow West Geauga High School graduate) Kelly. They have three children: Trenton, Keighle, and Bridey.
Committees
The House Appropriations Committee
As the U.S. Constitution says in Article I, Section 9, Clause 7: ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂNo money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of Appropriations made by Law.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
Comprised of 34 Republicans and 27 Democrats, the House Appropriations Committee is responsible for funding the federal governmentÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs basic operations and vital activities. Through the 12 appropriations bills that the Committee drafts each year, members work on behalf of the American people to scrutinize federal spending and determine how their tax dollars are best spent.

Speaker Mike Johnson appointed Dave to serve on the bipartisan House task force on the attempted assassination of Donald Trump comprised of seven Republicans and six Democrats. The Task Force is empowered with all investigative authority of the House of Representatives, including subpoena authority. For the remainder of this Congress, it will assume control and jurisdiction over all pending House committee investigations regarding the Trump assassination attempt. The goal of the Task Force is to understand what went wrong on the day of the attempted assassination, ensure accountability, and to prevent such an agency failure from ever happening again.

Biography
Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur proudly represents the working people of
Ohio's Ninth Congressional District
. She is currently the longest serving woman in the history of Congress and ranks among the most senior Members of the 118th Congress.
Background
Congresswoman Kaptur, a native Toledoan, lives in the same modest house where she grew up.
She is a Polish-American with humble, working class roots. Her family operated a small grocery store and her mother later served on the original organizing committee of a trade union at the Champion Spark Plug factory in Toledo.
After graduating from St. Ursula Academy, she became the first member of her family to attend college, earning a bachelor's degree
Here is the extracted text exactly as it is:

in history from the University of Wisconsin (1968) and later a master's degree in urban planning from the University of Michigan.
After working for 15 years as a city and regional planner, primarily in Toledo and Chicago, she accepted an appointment as a domestic policy advisor to President Jimmy Carter. During his Administration, she helped maneuver 17 housing and neighborhood revitalization bills through Congress.
In Congress
In 1981, while pursuing a doctorate in urban planning and development finance at MIT, she was recruited by the Lucas County Democratic Party to run for Congress against a first-term Republican. Although she was outspent by a 3-to-1 margin, Kaptur parlayed a strong economic message during the 1982 recession to stage a nationally-recognized upset.
In Washington, Kaptur fought vigorously to win a seat on the
House Appropriations Committee
. Today she serves as the first woman to serve as Ranking Member of the influential House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, which she considers an honor given the Ninth District stretches much of the southern Lake Erie coastline.
Federal Investments in Northern Ohio
Congresswoman Kaptur is widely credited with bringing back federal dollars to partner with local communities on crucial transportation and infrastructure projects:
The
I-280 Veterans' Glass City Skyway
, which is the largest bridge project in Ohio's history
Toledo's Farmers' Market
, which has expanded substantially with assistance secured by Congresswoman Kaptur
The Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge visitors center
Cranes and other heavy equipment for the Port of Toledo
State-of-the-art solar power array at the 180th Fighter Wing
The Center for Innovative Food Technology
Solar energy research projects at the University of Toled

Dedication ceremonies, May 29, 2004
Born into a family steeped in patriotism and military service, Congresswoman Kaptur has made support for America's seniors, including veterans, the touchstone of her career in Congress. That dedication was displayed during the long legislative battle she waged to have a World War II memorial built on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The idea came from Roger Durbin, a constituent who had fought in World War II. Congresswoman Kaptur worked together with Mr. Durbin to make his dream a reality. Despite many setbacks and detours, she never relented.
Seventeen years later, on a sunny May 29, 2004, Congresswoman Kaptur spoke as a crowd estimated at 150,000 people, including three presidents, gathered for the long-awaited dedication of the National World War II Memorial. ""What a privilege it has been to carry this dream forward for 17 years,"" she said.
President George W. Bush accepted the memorial on behalf of the American people, calling it a ""fitting tribute, open and expansive, like America: grand and enduring, like the achievements we honor.""
Roger Durbin had died four years earlier, but he was remembered and honored prominently during the ceremony. The memorial today is one of the most popular and beloved attractions in Washington, D.C. World War II veterans, now in their mid-eighties and nineties, are treated as heroes there every day.
Defense and National Security
Congresswoman Kaptur's effort on the memorial and her advocacy on behalf of veterans led the Veterans of Foreign Wars to honor her with their prestigious Americanism Award. She has also received the Prisoner of War ""Barbed Wire"" Award for her commitment to veteran

s' affairs.
She championed the cause of workers who got sick after exposure to beryllium by guiding a major piece of legislation to passage on their behalf. She has secured funding for a pathbreaking study into the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorders and other mental health issues among our armed forces. And she helped lead a community effort to save the 180th Fighter Wing in Toledo when it was threatened by the base closure commission.
International Affairs
Congresswoman Kaptur has always shown strong interest in America's standing in the world and its relations with other countries.
Image
She currently serves on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China and co-chairs the Congressional Hungarian Caucus and also the Ukraine Caucus.
A strong supporter of Middle East peace, she directed the first surplus farm commodities in 1999 to support the peace process in Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Congresswoman Kaptur remains dedicated to the development of democratic institutions globally.
She has spearheaded private charitable efforts to alleviate suffering in nations such as Ukraine and Vietnam.
As leader on issues related to international trade and human and labor rights, Kaptur has led the fight for fair trade laws, dating back to her opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Awards
In 1993, Congresswoman Kaptur was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the University of Toledo in recognition of her ""effective representation of the community."" St. Ursula Academy named Kaptur Alumna of the Year in 1995.
She is recipient of the Taubman College Distinguished Alumna award from the University of Michigan, making her the first woman so recognized and the first graduate of the Urban and Regional Planning Program to be so honored. 
---
---
Kaptur recently received the Director's Award from the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University for her commitment to increased understanding and appreciation of the peoples and cultures of Eurasia, Russia and East Europe.
She was named the National Mental Health Association's ""Legislator of the Year"" for her championing mental health and received the 2002 Ellis Island Medal of Honor.
Kaptur is also the author of a book,
Women in Congress: A Twentieth Century Odyssey
, that was published by Congressional Quarterly in 1996.
Dedicated to the principle that fiscal responsibility begins in ""one's own backyard,"" Congresswoman Kaptur has consistently returned money to the federal Treasury. She refuses to accept Congressional pay raises and donates them to offset the federal deficit and charitable causes in her home community.

About Val
Congresswoman Val Hoyle was born on Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, California.
As the oldest sibling,
you can always count on Val to tell you where she stands.
Growing up, Val got a front-row seat in community activism and service. Her father was a firefighter and labor leader, and her mom organized in support of the 1972 Equal Rights Amendment.
When Val was a teenager, she waited tables in high school and worked summers in a local bike shop.
Val was
also the first in her family to get a college degree
. She began school at Bunker Hill Community College, and later graduated from Emmanuel College with a bachelorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree in political science and a concentration in international studies.
After graduation, Val spent 25 years working in the international bicycle industry in retail management, manufacturing distribution, and international trade.
Val was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives in 2010 representing West Eugene and Junction City, and eventually served as Majority Leader. She was later elected statewide to serve as OregonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Labor Commissioner, a nonpartisan role leading OregonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Bureau of Labor and Industries. In January 2023, Val was sworn into the 118th U.S. Congress representing OregonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Fourth Congressional District.
Val and her husband, Stephen, are both proud union members. They moved to Lane County over 25 years ago to raise their two children.
My lived experiences help me support those who donÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt always have a seat at the table. My motto is never forget where you came from and never be afraid to do whatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs right.

Congresswoman Janelle Bynum
is a working mom of four, businesswoman, and former State Legislator who is working to elevate the needs and voices of OregonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Fifth. She knows that our voices arenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt being heard in Washington and she sees Congress playing political games with our livelihoods ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ thatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs why sheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs working to fix whatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs broken and deliver practical solutions to the issues impacting our communities.

Scott Perry brings a distinct background of hard work, small business and military leadership, and community involvement to the U.S. House of Representatives.
Perry earned the privilege of serving as the Congressman from PennsylvaniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 4th Congressional District (York, Adams & part Cumberland Counties) from 2013-2017.

ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂto give a voice to countless Americans who feel that Washington does not represent them. We support open, accountable and limited government, the Constitution and the Rule of Law, and policies that promote the liberty, safety and prosperity of all Americans.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
Perry served three terms in the Pennsylvania State House (2006-2012), where he established a record for protecting TaxpayersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ rights and interests.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  He served on the Committees on Appropriations, Consumer Affairs, Labor Relations, Veterans Affairs, Emergency Preparedness, and Rules.
Perry knows the importance of hard work and dedication. HeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs the grandson of Colombian immigrants, and the son of a single mom who fled abuse and worked several jobs to survive and support her children ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ with whom she finally landed in Central Pennsylvania in their first home in Harrisburg on Berryhill Street, then to Dillsburg.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Scott and his family were on public assistance for several years during his youth.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  He was raised in a spartan home that for several years had no electricity or plumbing, bathed in a steel tub on the porch, pumped water from a wel

About Summer
Born and raised in the Mon Valley, Summer Lee is a dedicated organizer, attorney, and progressive state legislator. A proud alum of Woodland Hills public schools, Summer grew up in North Braddock and Swissvale before graduating from Penn State and Howard University School of Law, where she focused on civil rights and social justice advocacy. She worked as labor organizer, joining the Fight for $15 to increase the minimum wage, and lead voter mobilization efforts for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. In 2017, after repeated incidents of violence from police and school administrators against local students, Summer spearheaded a successful write-in initiative that transformed the local school board.
In 2018, at the urging of her neighbors, Summer threw her hat in the ring for State House ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ taking on a 20-year incumbent, doubling voter turnout, and winning with over 67%of the vote. She also made history, becoming the first Black woman from Western Pennsylvania ever elected to the legislature.

.
Mike Kelly was born in Pittsburgh and raised in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he has lived for more than 50 years. After graduating from Butler High School in 1966, Mike attended the University of Notre Dame on a football and academic scholarship. After college, Mike moved back to Butler to work at Kelly Chevrolet-Cadillac, Inc., a company founded by his father in the early 1950s. Mike took ownership of the de

alership in the mid-1990s and expanded its operations to include Hyundai and KIA franchises.
As
The Washington Post
put it:
Kelly first got the itch to run for Congress in 2009, after the federal government took over General Motors. Kelly Motors has been in his family since his father started the business in 1953. In spring 2009, Kelly said, GM managers reviewed his Chevrolet-and-Cadillac dealership and concluded it was ""perfect.""
""Then they went to Washington and they got fired,"" Kelly said.
Under the government restructuring, he could sell Chevrolets but not Cadillacs.
""Wait, wait, wait!"" Kelly said he told a GM representative. ""This is America. You can't come in and take my business away from me. . . . Every penny we have is wrapped up in here. I've got 110 people that rely on me every two weeks to be paid. . . . And you call me up and in five minutes try to wipe out 56 years of a business?""
""'This is a new General Motors,'"" Kelly recalled the man telling him. ""'That's just the way it is.'""
Kelly went to arbitration and eventually won.
Fueled by his victory, Mike successfully ran for Congress the following year to take the fight to Washington and the rest, as the saying goes, is history.
Back in Butler, Mike's auto dealerships currently employ more than 100 people from the region, and are leaders in the local and national automotive industry. Mike has served as Chairman of the Hyundai Eastern Region Dealer Council, Vice Chairman of the Hyundai National Dealer Council, and has sat on the boards of the Chevrolet Dealers Advertising Association of Pittsburgh and the Cadillac Consultants of Western Pennsylvania. Additionally, Mike is a former Secretary and Treasurer of the Hyundai ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂHope on WheelsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ initiative, which has donated more than $145 million to childhood cancer r

esearch institutions nationwide. He continues to work with the organization as a lawmaker.  
Prior to entering Congress, Mike served on the Butler City Council and sat on the boards of several local and civic organizations, including the Housing Authority of Butler County, the Redevelopment Authority of Butler County, and the Moraine Trails Council of Boys Scouts of America. In recognition of MikeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs extensive volunteer and charitable work, Catholic Charities awarded him its Mary DeMucci Award. The Mayor of Butler designated October 26, 2001, as ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂMike Kelly DayÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ for his commitment to his hometown.  
Dedicated to improving education, Mike founded the Butler Quarterback Club and The Golden Tornado Scholastic Foundation, each of which provides unique and innovative educational programs for students in the Butler Area School District. Mike and his wife, Victoria, a former elementary school teacher, also established the Mary McTighe Kelly Creative Teaching Grant for elementary educators and the Lighthouse FoundationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs One Warm Coat Program, which has helped collect hundreds of winter coats for students in need in the Butler community.  
Mike and Victoria have four children and are the proud grandparents of ten wonderful grandchildren. MikeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs family and friends were with him on January 5, 2011, when he was sworn into office as the U.S. Representative of the Third Congressional District of Pennsylvania. Since January 3, 2019, Rep. Kelly has proudly represented Pennsylvania's 16th Congressional District.  
Mike is constantly honored and humbled to represent the values, interests, and concerns of the 16th District, especially as they relate to his work on the House Ways and Means Committee and his role as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Oversight. He is proud to be considered a lea
der among his colleagues as he serves as the Republican chairman of the Congressional Korea Caucus, the House Automotive Caucus, the Childhood Cancer Caucus, the House Retirement Security Caucus, the Health Care Innovation Caucus, and the House Small Brewers Caucus. He is also an appointed member on the President's Export Council.  
The  
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review  
refers to Mike as a ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂno-nonsense, straight-talking RepublicanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and ""a true man of the people."" According to

MikeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs rousing speeches on the floor of the House and at Ways and Means committee hearings have together earned more than 3 million views on YouTube. When he delivered the weekly Republican address to the nation right before Christmas 2014 (in which he offered President Obama a lump of coal for Christmas), it quickly became the most watched GOP weekly address of all time.  
During his time in the House, Mike has appeared on numerous national television programs, including ABCÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs

Image  
Congressman Dwight Evans represents Pennsylvania's 3rd Congressional District, which includes Northwest and West Philadelphia and parts of North, South and Center City Philadelphia. He was first elected in a special election in November 2016. Before that, he served as a state representative and made history as the first African-American chairman of the Hou
se Appropriations Committee.
Throughout his public service career, Congressman Evans has worked tirelessly to expand and broaden access to economic and educational opportunities for all Philadelphians. He currently serves on the influential Ways and Means Committee, which oversees Social Security, Medicare, taxes and trade. His priorities there include using the tax code to increase affordable housing, repair school buildings and strengthen the social safety net.
In his first term, he had one of his bills passed and signed into law, a true accomplishment for a freshman in the minority party. That law is designed to reduce costs for small business owners who apply for a loan through the Small Business Administration. In his first term, he also supported a criminal justice reform bill which became law, the First Step Act.
He proudly voted for landmark accomplishments during the first two years of President BidenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs term when Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress. These include the American Rescue Plan that provided a temporary expansion of the Child Tax Credit that lifted millions of kids out of poverty, a policy Congressman Evans wants to restore.
Congressman Evans also voted for the first major federal gun reform law in nearly 30 years, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act; the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which is delivering hundreds of millions of dollars for much-needed work in Philadelphia; and the Inflation Reduction Act, which is cutting the cost of prescription medications like insulin for millions of Americans, and includes the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs largest investment ever in fighting climate change.
Congressman Evans is a member of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force and continues to advocate for life-saving gun reforms such as ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂred flagÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ laws, r

estoring a version of the federal assault weapons ban that was in place from 1994 to 2004, and universal background checks for gun buyers. He also continues to support reforms like the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act that the House passed in 2021.
As part of the House Democratic majority that served from 2019 to 2022 and in the current Congress, Congressman Evans works to advance priorities such as protecting health care and reducing health disparities, and advocate for gun reform, criminal justice reform and economic development, including supporting small businesses. He works on these issues as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Black Maternal Health Caucus.
A lifelong resident of Philadelphia, he is a graduate of Germantown High School, the Community College of Philadelphia and LaSalle University. Congressman Evans will keep working to rebuild Philadelphia, and America, block by block!

Born and raised in Glenside, Pennsylvania, to Bob and Mary Dean, Madeleine got her start in politics around the dinner table with her five older brothers and one older sister. She graduated from Abington High School, and at age 18 won the election to serve as a local committee-person.
Madeleine completed her undergraduate studies at La Salle University in Philadelphia, and earned her law degree at Delaware Law School of Widener University. She returned home, practicing law in a small Philadelphia firm and with the Philadelphia Trial Lawyers Association and eventually serving as executive director. Madeleine then opened a small, thr

ee-woman law practice in Glenside.
While she and her husband PJ Cunnane were raising three young sons, Madeleine changed careers. From 2001 to 2011 she was a member of the English Department at LaSalle University, teaching writing and ethics. She also contributed to The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Daily News, The Patriot-News, and other publications.
With her children grown, Madeleine took the chance to enter public service ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ something she had long wanted ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ after studying politics and public service at PennÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Fels School of Government. In 2011, Madeleine ran for and served as Abington Township commissioner, before winning a special election to the Pennsylvania State House in 2012.
During her six-and-a-half years in Harrisburg, Madeleine was an outspoken champion of public education, healthcare access, environmental protection, equal rights, ethics, criminal justice reform, combating addiction, and ending gun violence. Following the Sandy Hook shooting, Madeleine founded and served as Co-Chair of the PA-SAFE Caucus, an active coalition of legislators and advocates dedicated to ending gun violence.
Throughout her career in the Legislature, Madeleine also worked closely with local officials to bring home millions of dollars in infrastructure projects that promote safer, greener, more livable communities. And with her extraordinary coworkers, her office served tens of thousands of constituents with problems big and small. In 2015, Governor Tom Wolf appointed Madeleine to the Pennsylvania Commission for Women, advising the Governor on policies and legislation to improve the lives of women and their families.
MadeleineÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs concern for equality ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and desire to expand her public service ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ eventually inspired her run for Congress. In 2018, Pennsylvania had 18 Congressional seats ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 
---
and zero women representing them. Along with a cadre of other women from across the state, Madeleine set out to change that. She ran for the Fourth Congressional District seat and won.
In Congress, Madeleine remains focused on decency and the common good. That means working hard to address issues that affect Americans deeply ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ including stopping gun violence and guaranteeing health care for all. In MadeleineÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs view, building a more compassionate society means making smart, humane policy choices. It also means working to ensure that the government functions smoothly and delivers the services constituents need.
Now in her fourth term, Congresswoman Dean serves on the House Appropriations and House Foreign Affairs Committees.
Madeleine and her husband PJ have three sons ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Patrick, Harry and Alex; three daughters-in-law ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Stephanie, Juliet, and Alyssa; and four granddaughters and one grandson ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Aubrey, Ella, Sawyer, Scottie, and Kennedy.

Biography
U.S. Representative Chrissy Houlahan is an Air Force veteran, engineer, entrepreneur, and educator who is continuing her career of service as the first woman ever to represent Pennsylvania's 6th District in Congress.
Chrissy is the daughter and granddaughter of Holocaust survivors who came to America with nothing. She grew up in a military family; her parents met when her father and grandfather flew P3s in the same Navy squadron. She earned her engineering degree from Stanford with an ROTC scholarship that launched her service in the U.S. Air Force and Air Force Reserves, and later earned her M.S. in Technology and Policy from MIT.
Chrissy has helped lead several thriving southeastern Pennsylvania companies, including AND1, a basketball apparel company headquartered in Paoli, and B Lab, the organization that launched the B Corporation movement. She went on to serve in Teach for America as a chemistry teacher at Simon Gratz High School in North Philadelphia and then led and scaled

 a nonprofit helping thousands of underserved students all across America build their literacy skills.
These experiences helped shape her political vision of a great nation united by shared values that leaves no one behind. She is committed to fighting for access to quality, affordable health care, common sense gun safety, government accountability and transparency, and working to build a strong, stable economy with good jobs and good benefits for everyone. While on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, she worked to promote peace and stability abroad, leading bipartisan legislation to address global malnutrition that was signed into law in October 2022.
Since serving her community in Congress, she has been awarded the Abraham Lincoln Leadership for America Award and three Congressional Management Foundation Democracy Awards. The Leadership for America award is presented by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to honor lawmakers for their work supporting a free enterprise system. The Democracy Awards recognized her outstanding achievement in the categories of Transparency and Accountability, Constituent Services, and Workplace Environment. Chrissy is the first member of Congress in history to win two categories in a single congressional term.
Chrissy is a leader driven by a spirit of service. She's a mom, a longtime resident of southeastern Pennsylvania, and a congressional representative working to solve real problems for the people and communities of Berks and Chester Counties.

nd
Congressional District.
Representative Magaziner grew up in Bristol, RI, the most patriotic town in America, and learned the importance of public service from a young age. He started his career as a public school teacher, and served as Rhode IslandÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs General Treasurer for eight years during which time he spearheaded an initiative to rebuild dozens of school buildings across the state and created new programs to invest in clean energy projects, creating thousands of jobs and lowering costs for ratepayers.
Representative Magaziner ran for Congress to fight for working people and protect the fundamental rights of all Americans. He has introduced bills to lower drug prices, guarantee paid time off for all workers, and invest in career and technical education to provide young people with training for good-paying jobs.
Representative Magaziner is committed to protecting Social Security and Medicare, protecting abortion rights and hol
ding Washington accountable. He co-sponsored legislation to protect Social Security and ensure benefits keep up with the cost of living, and co-sponsored the  
WomenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Health Protection Act  
to support a womanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs right to make her own health care decisions regarding abortion. Magaziner also believes elected officials should serve the people, not themselves, and has co-sponsored the bipartisan  
TRUST in Congress Act  
to ban lawmakers from trading stocks.  
In his short time in Congress, Representative Magaziner has been focused on delivering results for Rhode Islanders and has secured millions of dollars of federal funding for local projects to improve public safety, invest in schools and make Rhode Island a better place to live. Among the many federal grants secured by Magaziner are funding to support the police departments in Cranston and Coventry, rehabilitate public libraries in South Kingstown and Providence, prevent flooding in Johnston and develop the waterfront in East Greenwich.  
In the U.S. House of Representatives, Magaziner serves on the Natural Resources Committee and the Committee on Homeland Security, for which he is Ranking Member on the Subcommittee for Counterterrorism, Intelligence and Law Enforcement.  
Representative Magaziner is excited to continue fighting for Rhode Island and for working people across our country. He and his wife Julia are the proud parents of rambunctious youngsters Max and Lucy.

Congresswoman Mace, born in Fort Bragg and raised in the Lowcountry. Raised by a retired Army General and a retired school teacher, Mace learned the value of hard work early on. After leaving high school at 17, she began her journey in the workforce, starting as a waitress at the Waffle House on College Park Road in Ladson.  
Despite this early setback, Mace's determination led her to achieve academic excellence. She graduated magna cum laude from The Citadel, making history as the first female graduate from its Corps of Cadets in 1999. Continuing her education, she earned a master's degree from The University of Georgia in 2004.  
Driven by her commitment to education, Mace obtained her high school diploma through college courses at Trident Technical College in North Charleston.  
Transitioning into public service, she garnered acclaim as one of the most fiscally conservative members of the
---
South Carolina General Assembly, while also championing conservation efforts.
An accomplished author, Mace penned ""In The Company of Men: A Woman at The Citadel,"" published by Simon & Schuster in 2001. Building on her diverse experiences, she established her own company in 2008, specializing in technology, PR & marketing, and commercial real estate.
Mace's leadership embodies integrity, compassion, and a tireless pursuit of delivering results for the Lowcountry. She has collaborated with her colleagues on a bipartisan basis and managed to get a handful of bills signed into law by the President, including the Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act and the Human Trafficking Prevention Act of 2022. Mace has been recognized with esteemed awards such as the 2021 Club for Growth Defender of Economic Freedom Award.
She advocates for economic policies that strengthen the nation's economy while opposing tax hikes and harmful regulations. Her dedication extends to curbing wasteful government spending, earning her the 2023 White Coat Waste Warrior Award. Additionally, her commitment to education and job training for the underprivileged earned her the Champion Award from Palmetto Goodwill, alongside an impressive 97% rating with Conservation Voters of South Carolina.
A devoted mother to two teenagers, a sweet little Havanese named Liberty, and a cat named Tyler, Mace continues to serve the Lowcountry with unwavering dedication and resilience.

Biography
Congressman Russell Fry is proud to serve the Grand Strand and Pee Dee as their Representative for South CarolinaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Seventh Congressional District.
Russell is a true believer in the American Dream. Growing up he watched his parents work hard for every penny they earned, and since then Russell has been doing the same. He put himself through his undergraduate education at the University of South Carolina and law school at the Charleston School of Law, where he served as president of the Student Bar Association, helped the school achieve its American Bar Association accreditation, and also received the prestigious Civility Award. After this, he practiced law along the Grand Strand for over a decade.
As an Eagle Scout, Russell shares the sentiment that ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂyou should leave your campsite better than you found it.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Every day he strives towards a goal thatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwe should leave our country better than we found it.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Growing up, he saw first-hand how governmentÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs actions directly affect families living paych

Russell is a public servant and active member of his community. Prior to this role, he represented State House District 106 (Horry County) in South CarolinaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs General Assembly for seven years. He served as Chief Majority Whip, where he fought for lower taxes, less government, pro-Second Amendment legislation, and pro-life legislation. Russell also chaired the House Opioid Abuse Prevention Study Committee, which resulted in 18 policy initiatives being signed into law and record funding for opioid prevention, education, and treatment.
Russell is a loving husband to his wife, Bronwen, and dedicated father to their son, James. The family lives in Murrells Inlet with their chocolate lab, Jasper.

In Congress
Dusty Johnson brings an energetic and optimistic leadership style to Washington as South DakotaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs lone voice in the U.S. House of Representatives. As a ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂpolicy guy,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ he works hard to be a knowledgeable and value-added member on issues related to his committee assignments: Agriculture, Transportation & Infrastructure, and the Select Committee on China.
Committee on Agriculture
ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ A recognized leader in issues related to rural America, agriculture, livestock, and rural broadband, Dusty was grateful to be named Chairman of the Commodity Markets, Digital Assets, and Rural Development Subcommittee. Ahead of the reauthorization of the five-year Farm Bill, DustyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs role will give him more influence over cryptocurrency, commodities, and rural communities. Dusty also serves on the Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities, Risk Management, and Credit.
Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure
ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Dusty has remained focused on supply chain issues through ocean shipping reform, highway, manufacturing, and transit reform. T&I has jurisdiction over issues important to South Dakota, including railroads, aviation, pipelines, FEMA, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Dusty serves on the Subcommittee on Aviation; Highways and Transit; and Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials.
Select Committee on China
ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Dusty recognizes the 360-degree

threat China poses to all American citizens, our food security, and national security. His leadership prohibiting purchases of American ag land and ag businesses by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and banning TikTok on government devices led to his appointment on the Select Committee by Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Chairman Mike Gallagher (R-WI).
Republican Main Street Caucus
ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ As Chairman of the caucus, Dusty leads a group of 70+ pragmatic conservatives looking to pass commonsense solutions in Congress. Main Street is dedicated to getting things done and is active in organizing support for bills.
Business Background
Prior to being elected to Congress, Dusty served as vice president for Vantage Point Solutions, a South Dakota-based engineering and consulting firm specializing in rural telecommunications. Vantage Point has more than 200 employees and helps rural providers design, build, and operate broadband systems in 40 states. Dusty is an expert in state and national telecommunications policy, especially Federal Communications Commission reform efforts and the transformation of the Universal Service Fund.
Public Service Experience
In 2004, Dusty was elected statewide to the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission. He worked with his colleagues to maintain a fair and reasonable regulatory environment, facilitating the investment of hundreds of millions of dollars into rural energy and telecommunications infrastructure. In 2010, Governor Dennis Daugaard asked Dusty to serve as chief of staff, the chief operating officer for much of state government. In that role, Dusty oversaw many of the GovernorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs top projects and initiatives, especially those related to infrastructure and public safety.
Personal
Dusty grew up in a large working-class family in central South Dakota.
---

He has degrees from the University of South Dakota and the University of Kansas. Dusty has been an active community volunteer, having served as a Sunday School teacher, adjunct faculty member at Dakota Wesleyan University, and president and board member of Abbott House, an agency serving abused and neglected children. He lives in Mitchell with his wife and three sons. As a family, they enjoy hiking, camping, hunting, and reading.

U.S. Representative John Rose is serving his fourth term in Congress ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ representing Tennessee's Sixth Congressional District on the House Agriculture Committee and House Financial Services Committee. A lifelong Tennessean, he was raised in Cookeville and lives there with his wife Chelsea and sons Guy and Sam. He grew up working with his father on their more than 230-year-old family farm in the Temperance Hall and Lancaster communities of DeKalb and Smith Counties ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a proud legacy that he continues today.
As a farmer, attorney and small business owner, Representative RoseÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs life experiences as a political outsider have led him to become one of the most conservative members of Congress. That conservative perspective is front and center as   he works to reduce the National debt and reign in government spending in an effort to leave America better for the next generation.   He also believes in reducing burdensome federal regulations on individuals, families, businesses, and community banks, which is a regular part of his work on the prestigious House Financial Services Committee.
While elected office is a new chapter in his life, Representative Rose got his start in business as a successful young entrepreneur and remains the owner and president of Boson S

Mark Green first took the oath of office to represent the 7th District of Tennessee in Congress on January 3, 2019. It is the exact oath he first took as a cadet on the historic Plain at West Point more than thirty years earlier. As a successful business leader, decorated combat veteran, ER physician, and former Tennessee State Senator, Green is uniquely equipped to represent the people of his district.
Rep. Green serves as Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security and is a member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Congressman Mark Green grew up on a dirt road in Mississippi. After graduating from West Point, Green came to Tennessee during his last assignment in the Army as the flight surgeon for the premier special operations aviation regiment, known as the 160th SOAR. As a Night Stalker, Green served three deployments to Iraq and Af

ghanistan during the War on Terror. His most memorable mission was the capture of Saddam Hussein. During the mission, he interviewed Hussein for six hours. The encounter is detailed in a book Green authored,  
*A Night with Saddam*  
. Congressman Green was awarded the Bronze Star and the Air Medal with V Device for Valor, among many others.  

After his service in the Army, Green founded an emergency department staffing company that grew to over $200 million in annual revenue. The company provided staffing to 52 hospitals across 11 states. He also founded two medical clinics that provide free healthcare to under-served populations in Memphis and Clarksville, as well as numerous medical mission trips throughout the world.  

Green was elected to the Tennessee State Senate in 2012, where he distinguished himself as a conservative leader that fought for freedom and smaller government for all Tennesseans. His many legislative accomplishments include the repeal of the Hall Income Tax and the passage of the Tennessee Teacher Bill of Rights. He won the National Federation of Independent BusinessesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Guardian of Small Business award and the Latinos for TennesseeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Legislator of the Year award, among many other recognitions.  

As Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security in the 118th Congress, Green worked to hold the Biden-Harris administration accountable for its refusal to secure the border or comply with U.S. immigration laws. He led a five-phase investigation into the border crisis, covering everything from the human and financial cost, to the impact of cartels and the massive amount of waste and abuse under the leadership of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. On Feb. 13, 2024, the House of Representatives voted to impeach Secretary Mayorkas for high

To solve the crisis at the border, Green led the effort on the Homeland Security Committee to write the border security section of H.R. 2,
the Secure the Border Act
, the strongest border security legislation to ever pass the House.
In a major legislative victory, Rep. GreenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs
Protecting Hunting Heritage and Education Act
received overwhelming bipartisan support, passing both chambers of Congress nearly unanimously and was signed into law by the president. The bill protects funding for shooting sports and archery.
Rep. Green was also appointed to the Bipartisan Taskforce to investigate the attempted assassination of former President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania.
Furthermore, his 24 years of serviceÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂbetween the United States Military Academy, active-duty Army, and Army ReservesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂhave impressed upon him the need for well-cared for military families. As the representative of Fort Campbell, Green ensured veteran families were a priority during his time in the Tennessee State Senate, and has continued to do so during his time in Congress.
Green has also worked to improve resources for the mental and physical health of veterans. Since entering Congress, Rep. Green has fought on behalf of K2 veterans exposed to toxic and cancer-causing chemicals during the War on Terror.
Rep. GreenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs time serving in the Armed Forces also made him aware of the need for strong American leadership internationally, as well as the generational threat Communist China poses. Green has introduced numerous pieces of legislation to hold China accountable, including a slate of five bills focusing on bringing American businesses home and combatting ChinaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs malign influence.

would make the United States less dependent on Chinese manufacturing, increase economic opportunities in Latin America, and decrease migration to the U.S. Southwest border.
As a physician, Rep. Green recognizes that life begins at conception and strongly advocates for the unborn. Green also brings a unique perspective of a doctor, healthcare administrator, and cancer survivor to the issues surrounding rural healthcare in America. Rep. Green serves as a member of the House GOP Doctors Caucus that focuses on creating valuable solutions to AmericansÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ healthcare challenges. A two-time cancer survivor, Green serves as Chair of the bipartisan Congressional Colorectal Cancer Caucus. Rep. Green is also a member of the Bipartisan Rural Health Caucus to promote access to quality, affordable health care, and mental health services for all rural Americans.
Congressman Green has won multiple awards for his work in Congress, including the American Freedom FundÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Legislator of the Year Award for his work to empower veterans, the Ronald Wilson Reagan Award for his work advocating for veterans, families, and the military, and the Guardian of Small Business award from the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) in the 117th and 118th Congresses.

Rep. Randy Weber Official Photo
Congressman Randy Weber is a public servant, proven conservative, former small business owner, and third-generation Texan representing the 14th District of Texas.
In Congress, he serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which

has the broadest jurisdiction of any legislative committee in Congress. Weber also serves on the Science Space and Technology.
For over 70 years, Randy Weber has called the Gulf Coast home - a place to start a family and build a business. Although juggling work and family takes great amounts of time and effort, Weber makes time to be an active member of his church and community. Weber built his air conditioning company, WeberÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Air & Heat, in 1981 from scratch and grew his business by using what his grandfather used to call ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂgood old-fashion Texas horse sense and a strong work ethic.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Like others who have successfully moved from business to public service, WeberÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs real-world experience in the private sector underpins his commitment to lower taxes, his contempt for wasteful spending, and his firm dedication to better schools.
Prior to being elected to Congress, Weber served four years in the Texas State House. During his tenure, Weber served on the committees of Environmental Regulation, Public Education, and as Vice Chair of Border and Intergovernmental Affairs. While serving in the Texas House, Randy Weber authored landmark legislation to combat human trafficking and protect women, young girls, and boys - some as young as 12 years old.
Weber has lived in a 20-mile radius all his life and has been married to Brenda Weber, a retired schoolteacher, for over 47 years. He is a graduate of Alvin Community College, and holds a Bachelor of Science from the University of Houston at Clear Lake. Randy and Brenda have three children, eight wonderful grandchildren, and a precious great-granddaughter. He previously served on the House Foreign Affairs and Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

Her work on vital issues has earned recognition from civic groups, law enforcement, the National Border Patrol Council, and Texas Farm Bureau.
As a strong supporter of local agriculture, De La Cruz created the South Texas Water Working Group to tackle the regionÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs water challenges and has taken bold steps to hold the Mexican government accountable for its water debt.

Biography
Congresswoman Veronica Escobar, a third-generation El Pasoan, proudly represents TexasÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 16th Congressional District.
Since making history as the first woman elected to represent El Paso and the first of two Latinas from Texas to serve in Congress, Congresswoman Escobar has previously served on the prestigious House Judiciary Committee, House Armed Services Committee, and House Ethics Committee. She now currently serves on the powerful House Appropriations Committee.
She is a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the New Democrat Coalition, the Democratic WomenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Caucus, and the Pro-Choice Caucus. During the 118th Congress, Congresswoman Escobar was also elected and served as one of three co-chairs of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee (D

PCC).
In Congress, she has established herself as the voice of the border and as a national leader on gun safety, healthcare, reproductive justice, and immigration. She has led legislation to address our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs immigration challenges in a responsible and humane manner by ensuring accountability, transparency, and oversight. She has also led legislation to protect womenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs healthcare providers, patients, and staff by enhancing clinicsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ physical and cyber security. She has also championed efforts that support our men and women in uniform, as well as the well-being of their dependents and spouses.
Before her election, she served on the governing body for El Paso County, first as a County Commissioner and then as County Judge. There, she fought back against those who used government for their own personal gain and worked with her colleagues to modernize and reform the organization. She also worked to make El Paso County a leader in expanding access to healthcare by working with the University Medical Center of El Paso to build primary care clinics and the El Paso ChildrenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Hospital, the only childrenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs hospital on the U.S.- Mexico Border.
Prior to her service with El Paso County, Congresswoman Escobar was an English teacher at the University of Texas at El Paso and El Paso Community College, Communications Director for former Mayor Raymond Caballero, and the Executive Director of Community Scholars, a non-profit that taught high school students how to produce public policy reports and recommendations.
Congresswoman Escobar is a graduate of the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and New York University (NYU). She and her husband, Michael, live in Central El Paso with their beloved cats. They have two grown children.

About
Pete Sessions believes the United States of America is the greatest country on Earth and is a strong advocate for civility among our elected officials. As a Member of the 119th Congress, Pete is a voice of balance, reason, and common sense.
A native of Waco, Texas, Pete attended local public schools until the ninth grade. His father, Judge William Sessions, led a successful career as a Federal District Judge and was appointed to serve as the fourth Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation under President Ronald Reagan. His fatherÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs leadership instilled Pete with a sense of duty and integrity for elected and non-elected roles in public.
Pete attended Winston Churchill High School in San Antonio. Afterward, he graduated from Southwestern University in 1978. After college, he began working for the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company. Over his 16-year career, Pete never missed a day of work before retiring as District Manager.
He was first elected to Congress in 1996. Throughout his 24 years in Congress, Pete has been an integral player within the Republican Party. He spent a decade in Republican Party leadership and was instrumental in the House Majority b

alancing the federal budget from 1998 to 2001. Pete was Chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee from 2009 through 2012, leading to a net 63-seat victory in 2010. From 2013 to 2019, Congressman Sessions served as Chairman of the House Committee on Rules, where he revived bipartisan efforts and accelerated the Republican agenda in the House of Representatives.
He is currently a senior Member on the House Financial Services Committee and is the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Operations on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform
.
No member of the Texas delegation has passed more legislation off the floor than Congressman Sessions. Notably, he sponsored and passed the Border Tunnel Task Force Act in 2018 to create a directorate to intercept illegal tunneling operations on the southern border. One of PeteÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs key accomplishments was sponsoring and passing the Family Opportunity Act of 2005, which enables families of medically stressed children to receive comprehensive healthcare. The bill became law in 2006 after Congressman Sessions and his son Alex worked with President Bush.
Pete has always valued his community involvement throughout his life. He, his father, and two sons are Eagle Scouts. Over the years, he has served in various leadership roles with the Boy Scouts of America, disability assistance, and local conservation groups. He also devoted twelve years to serving on the Board of Trustees at his alma mater, Southwestern University.
Congressman Sessions lives in Waco, Texas, and is married to Karen Sessions. They are the proud parents of five sons. Bill and his wife Kayle are both doctors living in Austin, Texas. Alex is a special-needs young man who works for Home Depot in Austin. Conor is a U.S. Navy veteran. Liam, a 202

Biography
Jodey Arrington was raised in Plainview, Texas, the son of a tractor salesman and a schoolteacher. Jodey graduated from Texas Tech University and his passion of public service took him to Austin, Texas where he worked for Governor George W. Bush. He was then tapped by President Bush to join the White House as a senior advisor before being appointed as Chief of Staff to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In 2007, he returned to West Texas where he was Vice Chancellor of the Texas Tech University System before taking the helm as President of a healthcare innovation company in Lubbock.
In January of 2017, Jodey became only the fifth person to represent TexasÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 19th Congressional District since its formation in 1935. Starting his 3rd term in Congress, he continues to be an outspoken advocate for reining in the federal government, promoting agriculture and energy, strengthening national security, and respecting the Constitution while serving the largest agriculture and energy district in the United States.
In his first term, Jodey served as a member of the Agr

He was also appointed by Speaker Paul Ryan as the only freshman member to serve on the bicameral, bipartisan Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Reform. As a freshman, Jodey played a pivotal role in restoring cotton to the Farm Bill safety net, providing historic tax reform and regulatory relief, and making the largest investment in our military in over a decade.
Since 2019, Jodey has served on the Committee on Ways and Means. Dating back to 1789, Ways and Means has the broadest legislative jurisdiction including tax, trade, healthcare, social security, and welfare. As a member on the Committee, prioritizing rural AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs most critical issuesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂagriculture, energy, and healthcareÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwill remain his driving force. Jodey serves on the Subcommittees on Select Revenue Measures (tax), Trade, and Social Security.
In 2021, he was appointed to the U.S. CongressÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Joint Economic Committee (JEC) by House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy. The JEC is a bicameral Congressional Committee tasked with reviewing economic conditions and recommending improvements in economic policy.
At the beginning of the 118thÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¯Congress, Jodey was elected to serve as the Chairman of the House Budget Committee. With the national debt surpassing $31 trillion and over 120% of our entire economy, he believes confronting our unsustainable debt is the greatest challenge of the 21st century. He looks forward to working with his colleagues to ensure the next generations of Americans inherit the same freedoms and opportunities as the generations before them.

Congressman
Nathaniel Moran
Proudly Serving the First Congressional District of Texas
Nathaniel Moran became a Texan just a few months before he turned two years old when his parents moved to rural East Texas with other families of faith to help start a small Bible College in southern Smith County.  His formative years were spent growing up in a single-wide trailer home on that Bible College campus, where he learned from his parents the values of hard work, service to others, and service to God.  Nathaniel spent most of his childhood exploring the woods around the Bible College, riding bikes on bumpy county roads, and shooting snakes with his BB gun along the West Mud Creek.  Nathaniel and his family eventually moved to Whitehouse, Texas, where Nathaniel attended Whitehouse I.S.D. and graduated in 1993, proudly serving as Senior Class President and Captain of the Wildcat football team.  It was during NathanielÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs fourth grade year at Whitehouse that a l
---
ove for public service rooted itself in his heart, as heÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂguided by his fatherÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂclosely followed Ronald ReaganÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs bid for re-election as President.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  To this day, Nathaniel considers himself to be a Reagan Republican whose conservative values were shaped primarily by his father, President ReaganÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs service, and by the strong, steady voice of Rush Limbaugh over the talk radio air waves for more than two decades.  
After high school, Nathaniel attended the United States Military Academy at West Point for two years before transferring to Texas Tech University, where he ultimately earned a B.A. in Russian Language and Area Studies, an MBA, and a law degree.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  It was at Texas Tech that Nathaniel also met Kyna, whom he married just one week before starting law school.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Upon graduation from law school, Kyna and Nathaniel moved to Tyler, where Nathaniel began practicing law and Kyna began teaching elementary school.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  For the past two decades, NathanielÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs civil law practice has focused primarily on business and commercial litigation and transaction work.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Nathaniel and Kyna have now been married for over twenty-three years and they have four school-aged children, who serve as a primary motivation for his service in Congress.  
Nathaniel began his elected public service as a member of the City Council for the City of Tyler, Texas from 2005-2009.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  In 2009, just after being re-elected to his third term on the Tyler City Council, Nathaniel was appointed as Mayor Pro Tem, but resigned immediately to move his family to Houston, Texas for three years so that his oldest son could attend a specialized school for the Deaf.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  The unexpected opportunity to relocate his family for this purpose led to the miracle of his son learning to speak by age seven, something they did not think was possible.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Upon
---
returning to Tyler, Nathaniel returned to the practice of law and began giving back to his community through service with numerous non-profit organizations, including the Boy Scouts of America, the Discovery Science Place, Cancer Foundation for Life, and Tyler Area Chamber of Commerce.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  He also helped start an education foundation for Whitehouse I.S.D. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ At varying times over the past two decades, he has also been a Sunday School teacher, church deacon, trombone player for the church worship team, and coach of his daughtersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ basketball teams.
In 2016, Nathaniel was appointed as the Smith County Judge to fill a vacancy in that position.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  As Smith County Judge, Nathaniel served as the presiding officer of the Commissioners Court, Chief Budget Officer, judge of the Constitutional County Court (which had original jurisdiction over probate, guardianship, and civil mental health matters), chair of the Juvenile Board, head of emergency management, and chief administrative officer of the County.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  In 2018, he was elected to a full four-year term as County Judge and he continued in that role until he was elected to Congress in November 2022.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Because of his work in the area of mental health, Nathaniel was appointed to the Texas Judicial Commission on Mental Health in 2021. Nathaniel is proud of his decades of volunteer and elected service to his community and looks forward to continuing to fulfill this calling of service in Congress.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Ultimately, Nathaniel seeks to fulfill the Great Commandment found in Matthew 22: 36-40.

After high school, Nathaniel attended the United States Military Academy at West Point for two years before transferring to Texas Tech University, where he ultimately earned a B.A.
in Russian Language and Area Studies, an MBA, and a law degree.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  It was at Texas Tech that Nathaniel also met Kyna, whom he married just one week before starting law school.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Upon graduation from law school, Kyna and Nathaniel moved to Tyler, where Nathaniel began practicing law and Kyna began teaching elementary school.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  For the past two decades, NathanielÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs civil law practice has focused primarily on business and commercial litigation and transaction work.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Nathaniel and Kyna have now been married for over twenty-three years and they have four school-aged children, who serve as a primary motivation for his service in Congress.
Nathaniel began his elected public service as a member of the City Council for the City of Tyler, Texas from 2005-2009.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  In 2009, just after being re-elected to his third term on the Tyler City Council, Nathaniel was appointed as Mayor Pro Tem, but resigned immediately to move his family to Houston, Texas for three years so that his oldest son could attend a specialized school for the Deaf.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  The unexpected opportunity to relocate his family for this purpose led to the miracle of his son learning to speak by age seven, something they did not think was possible.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Upon
ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ At varying times over the past two decades, he has also been a Sunday School teacher, church deacon, trombone player for the church worship team, and coach of his daughtersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ basketball teams.",1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1,1,0,0,0

Meet Joaquin
Joaquin Castro was born in 
---
---
San Antonio, Texas on September 16, 1974. A second generation Mexican American, he was raised on the cityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs West Side and is a proud product of the public school system.
The Castro familyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs history in the United States began more than 100 years ago when his grandmother, Victoria Castro, came to Texas as a young orphan. In the spirit of the American Dream, she often worked two and three jobs at a time to be able to give her daughter (JoaquinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs mother, Rosie) and her grandchildren a better chance in life.

Meet Joaquin
Joaquin has worked hard to seize the opportunities created by the sacrifices of his grandmother and prior generations. After finishing high school a year early, Joaquin left San Antonio to graduate with honors from Stanford University in 1996. He then went on to attend Harvard Law School where he received his Juris Doctorate degree in 2000. Upon his return to San Antonio at 28 years old, Joaquin joined a private law practice and was elected to the Texas Legislature. He served five terms as state representative for District 125. In 2012, Joaquin was elected to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives as representative of Texas' 20th Congressional District, which covers a large portion of San Antonio and Bexar County. JoaquinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs identical twin brother, JuliÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡n Castro, was elected in 2013 to his third term as Mayor of San Antonio. On July 28, 2014, Julian Castro was sworn in as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
JoaquinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs respect for public service developed at a young age and was deeply influenced by his parentsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ involvement in political movements and civic causes. His father, a retired teacher,

and his mother, a renowned community activist, instilled in him a deep appreciation for the democratic process and the importance of serving oneÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs community.  
Despite a difficult political environment during his time as state legislator, Joaquin transcended partisan gridlock to help restore millions of dollars in funding to critical health care and education programs. As Vice Chairman of the Higher Education Committee and Democratic Floor Leader in the Texas House, he was also at the forefront in proposing forward-thinking legislative reforms in the areas of mental health, teen pregnancy, and juvenile justice.  
Now in his seventh term in the U.S. House of Representatives, Joaquin serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He was the 2013 Co-President for the House freshman Democrats and the Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for the 116th Congress.  
Outside of the legislative chamber, Joaquin has demonstrated a strong commitment to his community. He created the Trailblazers College Tour, personally raising money to send underprivileged students on college visits, giving them exposure to some of the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs best institutions of higher education. He also founded SA READS, San AntonioÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs largest literacy campaign and book drive. Over 200,000 books have been distributed to more than 150 schools and shelters across the city. To honor and express gratitude to San Antonio grandparents and other family members raising relatives who arenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt their children, Joaquin created the annual Families Helping Families dinner and awards. He has also taught as a visiting professor of law at St. MaryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs University and as an adjunct professor at Trinity University. Joaquin is active on several boards of education-related, non-pro
---
fit organizations, including the National College Advising Corps.
Having experienced AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs promise firsthand, Joaquin wants to help build out what he calls the Infrastructure of Opportunity so that future generations will have the same chance to pursue their American Dream. Joaquin believes that just as there is an infrastructure of transportation that helps us get to where we want to go on the road there is an Infrastructure of Opportunity that helps Americans get to where they want to go in life. It is that Infrastructure of Opportunity ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ great public schools and universities, a sound healthcare system, and good-paying jobs ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  that enables Americans to pursue their American Dream. Our centuries-long commitment to building and preserving this infrastructure is what distinguishes America among the nations of the world.
As Congressman, Joaquin continues to be a tireless advocate for those who call San Antonio home. From supporting military families to investing in education, Joaquin remains committed to helping mold an Infrastructure of Opportunity for San Antonians and Americans around the country.

Throughout his entire life, Tony Gonzales has made the choice to be a
fighter
in the face of adversity. He was abandoned by his father when he was two months old, and at age seven, Tony and his mother sought refuge at a battered womenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs shelter. For much of his youth, Tony was raised by his grandparents in San Antonio, Devine, and Camp Wood. When Tony was 18, his beloved grandfather passed away, leading Tony to leave high school and enter the Navy without a diplomaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂor even knowing how to swim.
Over his twenty years of service in our military, Tony rose to the NavyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs highest rank of Master Chief

Petty OfficerÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂan accomplishment that less than 1% of enlisted individuals achieve. He was deployed multiple times in support of combat operations in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom) and Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom) and regional security operations throughout Asia. While on the front lines, Tony was confronted with some of the most dire situations an individual can face.
Now in Congress, Tony represents the 23rd District of Texas, which covers more than 800 miles of the southern borderÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe largest border district in the country, larger than 30 states, and encompassing two time zones. Tony is currently serving his third term in Congress, where he sits on the critically important Appropriations and Homeland Security committees. Tony also serves as Vice-Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Conference, which is devoted to advocating for issues that are critical to the Hispanic community.
Though he entered the Navy without a high school diploma, Tony went on to earn his diploma, a graduate certificate from Georgetown University, a MasterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree in International Relations from American Public University, and he is now a Ph.D. candidate in International Development with an emphasis on Security Studies and International Politics at the University of Southern Mississippi. Prior to serving in Congress, Tony also served as a Department of Defense Legislative Fellow in U.S. Senator Marco RubioÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs office where he provided essential contributions to the SenatorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs defense, foreign policy, and intelligence portfolios.
Tony is active in his hometown community of San Antonio, where he and his wife, Angel, live and are raising their six wonderful children.

As a Texan, Beth is particularly interested in fostering policies that will empower our country with an abundant, affordable, and reliable energy supply to lower costs for families and deliver the power needed for our nation to enjoy an expansion of U.S.-based manufacturing.
In the 118
th

and conducted rigorous oversight of the Biden-Harris Administration, including its
failure to recover
tens of billions of dollars in stolen pandemic relief funds. Now, in the 119th Congress, Beth serves as Chairman of the Small Business Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax, and Capital Access
Prior to being elected to Congress, Beth served as Regional Administrator for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Mayor of Irving, Irving City Council Member, and a businesswoman.

Under her leadership, the City of Irving witnessed unprecedented economic growth and development with an added 40,000 jobs and an estimated $3 billion in growth and new developments while also being named the fifth safest city in America.
Throughout BethÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs career, she has worked with small startup companies, mid-size private companies and Fortune 500 corporations alike.

It is the honor of my lifetime to represent TexasÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 26th Congressional District. I was born on a military air force base in New Mexico and grew up on a cattle ranch in West Texas.
I attended Dartmouth College and graduated cum laude with degrees in both Economics and History. I was President of the conservative paper, The Dartmouth Review. I was also President of Christian Union and grew it to be one of the largest student groups on campus, despite being on a campus hostile to the Christian faith. In college, I fought the left nonstop - on their own turf - and I left Dartmouth even more conservative than when I arrived.
Upon graduation, I became an investment banker on Wall Street and then worked as an analyst at a global, multi-strategy hedge fund. For many people, I was living the American Dream. I was working in one of the largest, most successful hedge funds in the world, and rising fast in the industry.
Yet, the call for service and duty to my country came. I could not sit back as progressive politicians and their cheerleaders in the media worked hard to destroy all the things that make our country great. Biden and his Leftist allies have spent years inflicting disastrous economic pol

icies on millions of working-class Americans, in communities like the one I grew up in.
ThatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs why I left a successful career in finance. I soon launched DC Enquirer, a conservative, America First news outlet, which exploded in popularity almost overnight.
I am happily married to my wife, Danielle. She has written two books, one about Christianity, and the other is a pro-life book that debunks the LeftÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs pro-abortion arguments. She served on the Advisory Board of Women for Trump and led the Texas Women for Trump bus tour. She has spoken at churches in Texas, at Turning Point USA conferences, and at rallies before the Supreme Court to confirm Amy Coney Barrett. She is an amazing mother who continues to fight for the littlest among us.
I am also a father to our beautiful daughter, Marigold. I ran for Congress so she and all our children can live in a better America, and I look forward to serving in the 119th Congress to accomplish our shared Republican agenda.

Sylvia R. Garcia was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 2018, becoming the first Latina ever to represent the Texas 29th Congressional district.
Sylvia is a native of Palito Blanco, a South Texas farming community. The eighth of ten children, Congresswoman Garcia saw her parents struggle to raise her and her siblings. Congresswoman Garcia's parents taught her that with hard work and a good education she could accomplish anything. As a result of these lessons, Congresswoman Garcia dedicated herself to success at school. She earned a scholarship to Texas Woman's University in Denton, where she graduated with a degree in social work and political science.

n Houston, working several jobs to pay for her tuition. Just as her parents believed in her future, Congresswoman Garcia believes the children of Texas can do anything. Garcia has dedicated her life to her community and to public service. As a social worker and legal aid lawyer early in her professional career, she protected our community's most vulnerable, old and young, and ensured no one was forgotten.
Sylvia continued her public service career by serving as Director and Presiding Judge of the Houston Municipal System for an unprecedented five terms under two mayors. In 1998, she was elected City Controller, the second-highest elected official in Houston city government, and its chief financial officer. She quickly earned a reputation as the taxpayers' watchdog, fighting to protect the pocketbooks of working families and ensuring the City was transparent and accountable.
After two terms as Controller, Sylvia was elected to the Harris County Commissioner's Court. The first Hispanic and first woman to be elected in her own right to the office, she continued her advocacy for working families and made certain Harris County took care of its most defenseless, all while making certain Harris County led the way for new jobs and economic development.
Sylvia was sworn into the Texas State Senate on March 11, 2013, representing Senate District 6. She became the seventh woman and the third Hispanic woman to serve in the upper chambers after winning a special runoff election for the seat of the late Senator Mario Gallegos.
In 2018, Sylvia decided to take her fight to Washington. She ran to represent her community, country, and family in Congress. On Jan 3, 2019, she was sworn in to represent Texas Congressional District 29. She became the first Hispanic member of the Houston Cong

Congresswoman Garcia serves as the Vice Ranking Member of the House Financial Services Committee.

On January 15, 2020, she was selected as one of seven impeachment managers tasked with making the case to the American people and the Senate for the removal of Donald Trump as President of the United States. She is the first Hispanic and one of the first three women to ever serve as an impeachment manager in a presidential impeachment trial.

Originally from the Houston area, Rep. Dan Crenshaw is a proud 6th generation Texan. From an early age, Dan knew that he wanted to serve his country with the most elite fighting force in history: the U.S. Navy SEALs. His fatherÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs career in the Texas oil and gas industry moved his family all over the world, including Ecuador and Colombia, where he attended high school. As a result, Dan is fluent in Spanish.
In 2006, Dan graduated from Tufts University, where he earned his Naval officer commission through Navy ROTC. Following graduation, he immediately reported to SEAL training in Coronado, CA, where he met his future wife, Tara. After graduating SEAL training, Dan deployed to Fallujah, Iraq to join SEAL Team Three, his first of five deployments overseas.
On DanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs third deployment in 2012, his
---

 life changed forever. After six months of combat operations, he was hit by an IED blast during a mission in Helmand province, Afghanistan. He was evacuated and awoke from his medically induced coma learning that his right eye had been destroyed in the blast and his left eye was badly damaged. Dan was completely blind and the doctors did not believe he would ever see again. Tara stood by him every day and night, keeping faith and praying he would see again. After several difficult surgeries and months of fighting a tough diagnosis, Dan eventually regained sight in his left eye, a miracle according to the head surgeon. Dan refused to quit and went on to deploy twice more, first back to the Middle East in 2014 and then South Korea in 2016.
Dan was medically retired in September of 2016 as a Lieutenant Commander after serving ten years in the SEAL Teams. He left service with two Bronze Stars (one with Valor), the Purple Heart, and the Navy Commendation Medal with Valor, among others. Soon after, Dan completed his MasterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs in Public Administration at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. Dan then returned to Houston, where his community was hit by Hurricane Harvey. The storm brought devastation the region had never seen. He spent his time volunteering in areas of Katy, helping his neighbors recover from the damage. He saw first-hand the unthinkable losses that Texas suffered, but he also saw Texan grit and resilience. This inspired him to do more for his community.
Dan and Tara decided that the best way to serve the people of Texas would be in elected office.
In November 2018, Dan was elected to represent the people of TexasÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Second Congressional District. In Congress, he serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has the broadest jurisdiction of any legi

slative committee in Congress. On this Committee, Dan serves on the Subcommittee on Health, as well as the Subcommittee on Environment, Manufacturing, & Critical Materials, and the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.
Dan also serves on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. On this Committee, he serves on the
Central Intelligence Agency Subcommittee and National Intelligence Enterprise Subcommittee.
Dan believes in service before self and understands that there is no higher calling than service to the American people. Although he can no longer fight on the battlefield, the integrity, leadership, vision, and tenacity he learned in the SEAL teams are present every day in his fight for common sense solutions in Congress.

About the Congresswoman  
Image  
Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett has purposefully made every decision with one goal in mind: protecting the civil liberties of those in underrepresented communities. As a public defender, civil rights attorney, State Representative, and United States Congresswoman, Jasmine Crockett dedicates her life to public service, with the goal of serving justice and ensuring equality for all.  
In the midst of political turmoil, economic distress, and racial inequality, Congresswoman Crockett laced up her shoes to march for justice and run for the Texas House of Representatives. The sole Black freshman and youngest Black lawmaker in Texas du

ring the 87th Legislative Session, Congresswoman Crockett navigated what has been marked as the most conservative session in Texas history. Despite the uphill climb, Congresswoman Crockett filed more bills than any other freshman, assembled a wide coalition to pass landmark criminal justice reforms in the House, and brought more accessibility and accountability to her office than before. She was a founding member of both the Texas Progressive Caucus as well as the Texas Caucus on Climate, Energy, and the Environment. As State Representative, she fought for economic opportunity as a member of the Business & Industry Committee, and advocated for reform on the Criminal Jurisprudence Committee. Congresswoman Crockett was one of the lead architects of the 2021 Texas House Quorum Break, which brought attention to the draconian and restrictive voting measures being proposed in the legislature.
Her passion for justice and the protection of peoplesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ rights led her to pursue a career as a public defender, and civil rights and criminal defense attorney. She focused on defending our most vulnerable among us from exploitation in the criminal justice system. As she began her career in the Bowie County Public Defender's Office, Congresswoman Crockett worked tirelessly to keep children safe and out of jail. Her time there serves as a reminder that criminal justice is an intersectional issue.
Following her service in the Texas Legislature, Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett has served as the U.S. Representative for Texas 30
th
Congressional District since January 2023, representing portions of Dallas and Tarrant counties, representing the seat previously held for 30 years by the late Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson. . In the 118th Congress, Congresswoman Crockett was elected as Freshman

 Leadership Representative, and in the 119th Congress she was appointed to the position of Vice Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight. She currently serves on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. She was also appointed as Communications Task Force Co-Chair for the Democratic Women's Caucus.
Congresswoman Crockett earned her B.A. in Business Administration from Rhodes College and her J.D. from the University of Houston. She is licensed to practice law in Texas, Arkansas, and Federal Courts. Crockett is the past Bowie County Democratic Party Chair, held various leadership positions within the legal community, is a former board member of the Dallas County Metrocare Services, and is a proud member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated.

John was a young lawyer who recently completed his bachelorÃÂs degree from Texas Tech and his law degree from University of Texas. At first, he was only one of two lawyers in Round Rock, Texas, but a decade later John Carter was appointed District Judge for the 277th District Court in Williamson County. During that time, he aptly earned the nickname that stuck with him to this day; Judge.

On the bench, Judge was known for his no-nonsense approach to keeping our community safe. In fact, it was this mentality that encouraged him to run for Congress in 2002. When he watched the towers fall and saw his nation in mourning on September 11, 2001, he looked for ways to serve his country. As a judge, John was known for bringing justice to those who harmed others, and he realized that this experience would be useful in Congress as the nation went to war against a new enemy.

JudgeÃÂs expertise on protecting the homeland, his commitment to our military and their families, and his integrity for taking care of veterans, quickly catapulted him into leadership positions among the Republican caucus. Judge currently serves as the Chairman on the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Committee. He also sits on the Commerce, Justice and Science subcommittee and the Defense subcommittee. He is one of the few members that has passed legislation under Presidents Bush, Obama and Trump.

Judge prides himself on delivering results for TexasÃÂ 31st district no matter the political environment, and does this by following his guiding principle, ÃÂlisten more than you speak.ÃÂ ItÃÂs this belief that has allowed Judge to pass legislation like the Veterans Transplant Coverage Act, which stemmed from a Leander constituent being denied live-donor coverage from the VA. When Representative Carter heard this story, he went to work and passed legislation to ensure that the VA can never deny another veteran life-saving donor coverage. 

To Judge, Central Texas is home, and Washington is simply where he works. ThatÃÂs why he chooses to sleep on a pull-out couch in his office when he works in DC and hops on the first flight back to GodÃÂs Country after final votes. When heÃÂs not working, heÃÂs babysitting his seven grandchildren and spending time with his wife of 53 years and their four children. Together, Erika and John have raised their family on strong Christian beliefs and Texas values.",0,0,0,0,0,"When John Carter settled down in Central Texas with his wife, Erika, he knew it was the right place to raise his family because of the great schools, low taxes, and safe communities.

Congressman Greg Casar represents TexasÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 35th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives, which runs down I-35 from East Austin to Hays County to the West Side of San Antonio.
Congressman Casar was sworn into office in January 2023 and serves as the Chair of the
Congressional Progressive Caucus
, composed of more than 100 members of Congress standing up for progressive ideals in Washington and throughout the country. A labor organizer and son of Mexican immigrants, he is fighting to raise wages for millions of American workers, expand immigrant rights, restore abortion rights and voting rights, protect veterans and seniors, and tackle the climate crisis.
Prior to being elected to Congress, he served on the Austin City Council for seven years. There, he championed and passed progressive policies including
---
protections for renters from corporate abuse, bold affordable housing programs, and paid sick leave ordinances in Austin, Dallas, and San Antonio.
In the U.S. House, Congressman Casar has pledged to build a government that works for working people. In his first term in Congress, Congressman Casar successfully pushed for the introduction of the first-ever federal heat rule, which will protect over 30 million American workers facing extreme heat on the job. Additionally, he authored legislation to connect the Texas grid to neighboring power grids that would save billions and prevent future mass blackouts.

Biography
About Brian
Born in Port Arthur and growing up in Beaumont, Congressman Brian Babin is a lifelong resident of East Texas. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science from Lamar University and completed dental school at the University of Texas Dental Branch in Houston, Texas.
Dr. Babin held various jobs to put himself through school, including merchant seaman, janitor, musician, disc jockey, and U.S. Post Office letter carrier. He was also an airborne artilleryman in the Texas Army National Guard. Following his graduation from dental school, Dr. Babin was commissioned as a Captain in the United States Air Force and stationed overseas in Ramstein, Germany.
In 1979, he returned to East Texas and settled in Woodville, where he opened a dental office serving the surrounding co

mmunity for over 30 years. In addition to maintaining his successful dental practice, he has served as WoodvilleÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs mayor, a city councilman, a school board member, and various other civic roles, including Director and Vice President of the Tyler County Chamber of Commerce and Lions Club President.
Since 1999, Dr. Babin has held a position on the Lower Neches Valley Authority. He has also been a member of the Texas State Historical Commission, the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners, and the Deep East Texas Council of Governments.
On January 5, 2015, Dr. Babin was sworn into the 114th Congress. He was appointed to two critically important committees to the 36th District. His service on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee allows him to address the vital ports, highways, rails, and pipelines that provide thousands of jobs and fuel a hub of economic activity that includes more petrochemical refining facilities than any other congressional district in the country.
He was also appointed as the Chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology at the beginning of the 119th Congress. As the Chairman of the Committee, he serves as a national leader for U.S. space policy and represents the interests of NASAÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Johnson Space Center, also located in the district.
He and his wife, Roxanne, are members of the First Baptist Church of Woodville, where he has served as a deacon, Sunday school teacher, choir member, and as a member of Gideons International. The couple have been married since 1972; they have five children and 17 grandchildren. Ensuring America is safe, strong, and economically secure for his children and grandchildren remains his reason for running to maintain his seat in Congress and proudly serve the people of TX-36.

th of office to serve the people of TexasÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 9th Congressional District and began his eleventh term in the United States House of Representatives. As a veteran civil rights advocate, he has fought for those in society whose voices, too often, are not heard.
Congressman Al Green currently serves on the House Committees on Financial Services, including the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions, and as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.
Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, Congressman Al GreenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs family taught him the importance of positive preparation through education and righteous resistance to overcome persistent injustice. He attended Florida A&M University, Howard University, and the Tuskegee Institute. Before receiving an undergraduate degree, he enrolled in the Thurgood Marshall School of Law, where he earned his Juris Doctorate in 1973. As a law student, he earned awards and commendations in the areas of Federal Procedure and Conflicts.
Upon graduating from law school, Congressman Al Green co-founded and co-managed the law firm of Green, Wilson, Dewberry, and Fitch. In 1977, he was elected Justice of the Peace in Harris County, Texas, where he served for 26 years before retiring in 2004. During his time as judge, Congressman Al Green served as president of the Houston Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) for approximately ten years. Under his leadership, the organization grew to unprecedented heights, increasing membership from a few hundred to many thousands and the staff from one to more than ten. He also helped orchestrate the purchase of the chapterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs headquarters building.

As a testament to his exceptional service to the community and in recognition of his outstanding professional achievement as well as his superior leadership ability, Congressman Al Green has received numerous awards. These awards include the Texas Association of REALTORS Legacy Award, Texas Black DemocratsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Profiles of Courage Award; the AFL-CIO MLK Drum Major Award for Service, Ebony MagazineÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 100 Most Influential Black People, and the Mickey Leland Humanitarian Award, from the NAACP Houston Branch as well as the NAACP Fort Bend Branch. Congressman Green has also been honored by the City of Houston with ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂAl Green Day,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ named as such to applaud his continued commitment to communities and people across the Greater Houston area.

Member Profile
In 2004, Al Green won election to the U.S. House of Representatives from the Houston area Ninth District. Rep. Green, a son of the segregated south, born in New Orleans, Louisiana on September 1, 1947, has devoted his life to the elimination of all forms of invidious discrimination and the rectification of AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs seminal sin: slavery. His mother, a 
---
---
maid, and father, a mechanicÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs helper, emphasized the importance of an education. Without acquiring an undergraduate degree, he earned his law degree from the Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University in 1974.
Upon graduating from law school, Green cofounded the law firm, Green, Wilson, Dewberry, and Fitch. In 1977, he was appointed justice of the peace in Harris County, Texas, and served until retiring in 2004. For nearly 10 years, Green served as president of the Houston branch of the NAACP. Under his leadership, the organization grew from 500 members to 3,500, expanded its budget, and acquired property to serve as its headquarters. He stepped down as president in 1995.
In 2004, Green, who considers himself a liberated democrat, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂunbought, unbossed and unafraid,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ entered the congressional race for the newly configured Ninth District. Green ran on his long record of public service in Houston, emerging as the winner in the March Democratic primary with 66 percent of the vote. He prevailed in the general election with 72 percent of the vote.
In the current Congress, Green serves as the ranking member of the Oversight Subcommittee of the Financial Services Committee
In his first term, Green introduced the Homes for Heroes Act. The bill created a veteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ affairs position in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to assist veterans experiencing homelessness to find affordable housing. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂI am sorry to report, Mr. Speaker,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Green said on the House Floor when the bill came up for debate, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthat as many are sleeping in the suites of life, too many are sleeping on the streets of life.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ The measure was passed in 2016 when it was included in the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act and was signed into law.
Green became the first lawmaker t

o introduce and force a vote on three articles of impeachment against President Donald J. Trump in the 115th and 116th Congresses. When the House finally passed articles of impeachment in 2019 and 2021, Green voted for all of them.  
Supported by his Texas Democratic Congressional Colleagues and both United States Senators from Texas, Green recommended Attorney Gregg Costa in 2011 as well as Federal Magistrate George Hanks and Harris County District Court Judge Al Bennett in 2014 for Federal District Court Judgeships. Additionally in 2014, Green recommended Judge Gregg Costa be elevated to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. All three were nominated by President Obama and confirmed by the Senate to their respective benches.  
In December 2020, GreenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs legislation establishing an Emergency Capital Investment Program became law as part of the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The legislation established a $9 billion Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) for minority depository institutions and Community Development Financial Institutions serving low- and moderate-income communities.  
In March 2021, GreenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs legislation reauthorizing and funding the State Small Business Credit Initiative was included in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The legislation reauthorized and funded the State Small Business Credit Initiative at $10 billion. The funds expanded access to capital for small businesses still adapting to the pandemic and seeking to create high-quality jobs across the nation. The funding is expected to catalyze $100 billion in private investment for small businesses.  
In November 2021, GreenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs legislation, H.R. 2689, the Minority Business Resiliency Act, was signed into law as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The Minority Business Development A

gency (MBDA) is the only federal agency dedicated solely to the growth of minority businesses. H.R. 2689 permanently codified the MBDA in federal law to promote and administer programs to assist the development and resiliency of minority business enterprises.
This Congress, Representative Green has introduced three resolutions designed to start healing the chasm of racial animus that exists within our nation today. The first of these is the Slavery Remembrance Day resolution, a resolution to create a commemorative day to remember the victims of slavery. The second is a resolution to remove the name of Richard B. Russell, a self-proclaimed white supremacist, from the Russell Senate Office Building. The third is a resolution to create a Cabinet-level Department of Reconciliation which would be tasked with eliminating racism and discrimination in the United States.
During his tenure as a U.S. Representative, Green has been successful in securing over $100 million worth of funding for community projects for the Texas Ninth Congressional District.

Meet Blake
A native of Ogden, Blake Moore is a proactive problem solver committed to representing each and every constituent of UtahÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs First District. He is dedicated to reflecting UtahÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs values in Congress and finding solutions to the challenges facing

the district and the state. Advocating for inclusive, pro-growth, and aspirational principles, Blake is amplifying Northern UtahÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs voice on a national level to ensure Utahns receive the service and representation they deserve.
Blake currently serves as the first-ever Utah Republican on the
House Ways and Means Committee
, where he sits on the Healthcare, Social Security, and Work and Welfare subcommittees. He also serves on the House Budget Committee to push for policies to reverse our national debt crisis and advocate for UtahÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs defense community. Blake continues to represent Hill Air Force Base as co-chair of the Armed Forces and Depot caucuses, and he was elected in November of 2023 to join the House leadership ranks as the Vice Chair of the House Republican Conference. He is the first Utahn to ever be elected to House or Senate leadership.
Before being elected to Congress, Blake worked for small businesses and in the foreign service, experiences that now guide his work on domestic and foreign policy. As a Principal at Cicero Group, Blake worked primarily in the social impact, marketing research, and strategy practice areas leading projects and serving clients throughout Utah and the nation. He has expertise in education, financial services, public policy, healthcare, transportation, supply chain, and waste industries, and this work informs his customer service and problem solver approach in Washington, D.C., as he identifies ways to help the federal government better work for Northern Utah. His passion for helping organizations manage the change process drives his ambition to overcome partisan gridlock, improve federal agencies, and smartly streamline the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs bureaucracy.
Previously, Blake worked abroad in business development in the healthcare and financial se

rvices industries, which led him to understand the challenges that small businesses grapple with daily. Blake was also honored to serve in the Foreign Service for the U.S. Department of State, where he gained first-hand knowledge of AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs international threats. This experience taught him to take seriously the United StatesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ diplomatic apparatus, the readiness of the Armed Forces, and the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs commitment to strengthening partnerships and alliances across the globe.
Blake joined Congress in 2021 and served on the Armed Services, Natural Resources, and Budget committees during his first term. On these committees, he advocated for Hill Air Force Base and UtahÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs defense community, promoted domestic energy production, worked on addressing our debt and deficit crises, among several other efforts. Congressman Moore convened a
Debt and Deficit Task Force
in Ogden to create a framework of solutions with local leaders for how the federal government can grow the economy, save and strengthen vital programs, focus AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs spending, and fix CongressÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs budgeting process. For these efforts, he was named a 2022 Fiscal Hero by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. He also successfully pushed for provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act packages for FY22 and FY23 that support Hill Air Force BaseÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs modernization efforts, Sentinel program, housing availability, and more.
Blake was the most successful freshman Republican member in terms of legislation passed, with four bills signed into law by President Biden and several more passed through committee. His bills that became law are the
Saline Lake Ecosystems in the Great Basin States Program Act
, the
Better Cybercrime Metrics Act
, the
National Medal of Honor Act
, the
Modernizing Access to our Public Land Act

Here is the extracted text exactly as provided:

, and provisions in the Afghanistan Accountability Act.
Blake is an active and valued team player within the House Republican Conference, chosen to serve as an Assistant Whip on the Republican Whip Team, the House Armed Services Committee conferee on the China legislation conference committee, and co-chair of the bipartisan Depot, Air Force, and Future caucuses.
Blake obtained a MasterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs in Public Policy and Administration from Northwestern University. He graduated from the University of Utah after serving a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Seoul, South Korea, and signing a scholarship to play as the quarterback at Utah State University. In high school, he was awarded the WendyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs National High School Heisman, an award honoring one male and one female senior for excellence in athletics, academics, and citizenship. He remembers fondly a conversation with a Heisman trustee after the ceremony. The trustee mentioned that it was BlakeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Eagle Scout and other service projects that set him apart. Blake recalls thinking at that moment, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂIÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂm not special; thatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs just the way kids are raised in Northern Utah!ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
Blake is married to Jane Boyer, his amazing, humorous, and very candid wife, who encourages him to take risks and pursue big things. Blake and Jane have four awesome and active boys who keep them on their toes- Max, George, Winston, and Franklin. Even with a congressional term under his belt, BlakeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs most prized title is ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂLittle League Coach.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

Biography
Burgess Owens is the Congressman from UtahÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Fourth Congressional District. Raised in the segregated South, he saw people of all backgrounds come together to work tirelessly against adversity.
As a young man, Burgess was one of the first four black athletes recruited to play football at the University of Miami and the third black student there to receive a scholarship, ultimately earning BS in biology and chemistry. He was the 13th pick in the first round of the 1973 NFL draft and joined the New York Jets, later playing safety for ten seasons in the NFL for the New York Jets and the Oakland Raiders, winning the Superbowl with the 1980 RaidersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ team.
After retiring from the NFL, Burgess worked in the corporate sales world and eventually moved the Owens family to beautiful Utah. Before being elected to Congress, he started Second Chance 4 Youth, a non-profit dedicated to helping troubled and incarcerated youth.
Burgess now serves as a member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee and House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Burgess believes in dreaming big and follows the four guiding principles of faith, family, free markets, and education.

use Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence where she was the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on National Intelligence Enterprise.
As Ranking Member of the House Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, Ms. Plaskett worked to ensure Democratic members focused on evidence-based inquiries and not wild conspiracy theories. The RepublicansÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ attempts to derail the federal governmentÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs obligation to investigate and conduct due process on actions, organizations, and individuals that threaten our republic and create an anti-democratic environment were met with strong resistance by Ms. Plaskett and her Democratic colleagues.
Congresswoman Plaskett is the first member of a territory to be named a Ranking Member of a Select Committee and the first to be a member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. As a graduate of Georgetown UniversityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs School of Foreign Service with a Bachelor of Science in History and Diplomacy and a concentration in Middle East and African Studies, Congresswoman Plaskett's training is uniquely oriented to focus on the geopolitical and global paradigm. Additionally, Congresswoman Plaskett's legal expertise and background lends to her oversight ability, in which she has exhibited an even-handed approach to engaging opposing sides on contentious issues.
As the Ranking Member of the Intelligence Committee's Subcommittee on National Intelligence Enterprise, Ms. Plaskett called on her knowledge to ensure accountability and transparency in US Intelligence work in counter and other intelligence matters. Ms. Plaskett has taken great interest and worked to develop expertise on the serious security situation in West Africa and the complex threats from terrorism and the malign influences of Russia and China, which jeopardize

 stability and increase the prospect for further democratic backsliding.
In 2021, Ms. Plaskett was appointed by then Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, to be one of the nine impeachment managers to prosecute President Trump in the U.S. Senate for incitement of the insurrection of January 6, 2021. Ms. Plaskett conducted some of the most detailed presentations of the events of the day and was one of the managers chosen to respond to the questions of U.S. Senators during a day of the proceedings. At the time of the Senate trial, Ms. Plaskett was the only Black woman in the Senate Chamber.
In the 117th Congress, Ms. Plaskett was unanimously elected by her Democratic colleagues to serve on the House Committee on Ways and Means, the oldest and one of the most exclusive committees in Congress. In true historic fashion, Ms. Plaskett was the first Member from a U.S. territory and only the fourth African American woman to serve on this committee. Additionally, she has served on the House Agriculture and Transportation and Infrastructure Committees, as well as the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.
Congresswoman Plaskett has participated in numerous international panels and summits, including a guest presentation at Oxford Union on the ideological American Civil War of the 2020s and the Web Summit on the role of government in regulating and promoting the digital economy. Ms. Plaskett is one of the founders and co-chairs of the Congressional Caucus on Black Innovation, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and the New Democrat Coalition. Congresswoman Plaskett also co-chairs the Congressional Caribbean Caucus.
Ms. Plaskett is a staunch advocate for poverty-reduction and equal voting rights and is well versed in Caribbean economic development and public-private partners

Prior to coming to Congress, Ms. Plaskett was counsel to a private equity firm. She served as General Counsel to the US Virgin Islands Economic Development Authority working on tax and project finance. Congresswoman Plaskett served as a political appointee in the Bush AdministrationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Department of Justice after September 11 and started her legal career as an Assistant District Attorney in the Bronx, New York. She is a graduate of Choate Rosemary Hall, earned her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and received her Juris Doctorate from American UniversityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Washington College of Law. Most importantly, Ms. Plaskett is the mother of 5 ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ four adult sons and a younger daughter, and the wife of Jonathan Buckney-Small.

Biography
Congresswoman Jen Kiggans is proudly serving VirginiaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Second Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives, which includes Virginia Beach, the Eastern Shore, part of Chesapeake and Southampton, Isle of Wight, Suffolk, and Franklin City.
Jen is a proud Navy Wife to her husband Steve, a retired F-18 pilot, and mom to their four amazing children who motivate her every day to fight for a stronger future for Virginia and our nation as a whole.
Prior to serving Virginians in public office, Jen served as a helicopter pilot in the U.S. Navy and worked in our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs healthcare system as a Geriatric Nurse Practitioner, serving AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs aging population.
Jen was winged as a Naval Aviator in 1995. She served our nation for a total of 10 years as a helicopter pilot flying H-46 and H-3 helicopters, completing two deployments to the Persian Gulf. As a former Navy helicopter pilot, Navy spouse, and now Navy Mom, Jen is a tireless advocate for the military community and is a strong voice for them in Congress.
After serving in the U.S. Navy, Jen used her GI Bill benefits to go back to school and become a board-certified Adult-Geriatric Primary Care Nurse Practitioner. A graduate of Old Dominion UniversityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Nursing School and Vanderbilt UniversityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Nurse Practitioner program, Jen has worked in several long-term care and nursing facilities in Virginia Beach and Norfolk in addition to serving as a primary care provider for a small private practice in Virginia Beach.
After years of growing frustration listening to politicians on the evening news and watching as division and negative rhetoric derailed legislative progress on issues important to her family and her co

mmunity, Jen took her experience of working with a team to accomplish the mission at hand to Richmond. She served three sessions in the Virginia State Senate, where she successfully championed legislation to establish a Military Spouse Liaison and advocated for patients, families, and caregivers in long-term care facilities.
Jen comes to Congress determined to bring civility and competence to politics ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ something she believes is severely lacking in all levels of government ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and provide Virginians with the strong, independent leadership in Washington they deserve.
Jen, Steve, and their four kids live in Virginia Beach with their dog Chloe, cat Zoe, and bird Barbie.

Congressman Robert C. ""Bobby"" Scott has represented Virginia's third congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives since 1993. Prior to his service in Congress, he served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1978 to 1983 and in the Senate of Virginia from 1983 to 1993.
During his tenure in the Virginia General Assembly, Congressman Scott successfully sponsored laws critical to Virginians in educat
---
ion, employment, health care, social services, economic development, crime prevention and consumer protection. His legislative successes in the General Assembly included laws that increased Virginia's minimum wage, created the Governor's Employment and Training Council and improved health care benefits for women, infants and children.  
His 1992 election to Congress gave Congressman Scott the distinction of being the first African-American elected to Congress from Virginia since John Mercer LangstonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs election more than 100 years earlier during the Reconstruction era. Having a maternal grandfather of Filipino ancestry also gives him the distinction of being the first American with Filipino ancestry to serve as a voting member of Congress.  
In the 119  
th  
Congress, Congressman Scott serves as the Ranking Member of the  
Committee on Education and Workforce  
ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂhis sixth term as the CommitteeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Democratic leader. Throughout his tenure, he has advanced legislation that improves equity in education, frees students from the burdens of debt, protects and expands access to affordable health care, ensures workers have a safe workplace where they can earn a living wage free from discrimination, and guarantees seniors have a secure and dignified retirement. Congressman Scott also serves on the  
Committee on the Budget  
where he is a leading voice on fiscal policy.  
During the 116  
th  
and 117  
th  
Congresses (2019-2023), Congressman Scott served as Chairman of what was then called the Committee on Education and Labor. As Chairman, Congressman Scott spearheaded critical parts of CongressÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through several COVID-19 packagesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂincluding the  
American Rescue Plan Act  
ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂCongressman ScottÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs efforts saved the pensions of over one million workers and retirees; reduced the n
umber of uninsured Americans to record lows; significantly reduced child hunger across the nation; and delivered the single largest investment to K-12 schools in U.S. history to help schools reopen safely and make up for lost learning time. Notably, Congressman Scott has championed several other landmark bills in the House of RepresentativesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂincluding the  
Every Student Succeeds Act  
, the  
Raise the Wage Act,  
the  
Protecting the Right to Organize Act,  
the  
Equity Inclusion and Enforcement Act,  
and the  
Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2017  
, which included key components of Congressman ScottÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs  
Youth PROMISE Act.  
Congressman Scott has also served on the  
Committee on the Judiciary  
, and he remains a leading voice in Congress on the Constitution and reforming our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs criminal justice system.  
During his tenure as Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on the JudiciaryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security, Congressman Scott authored several bills to improve and reform our nation's criminal justice system. He sponsored the  
Death in Custody Reporting Act  
, which enhances transparency and accountability for law enforcement by requiring state and local law enforcement agencies to report to the U.S. Department of Justice data on how many individuals die annually in custody or during arrest. In 2010, Congressman Scott successfully led efforts in the House to pass the  
Fair Sentencing Act  
, one of the first successful reductions in a federal mandatory minimum sentence in decades that reduced the unfair sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. In 2015, he worked across the aisle to sponsor the  
Safe, Accountable, Fair, and Effective (SAFE) Justice Act  
, of which several important provisions were included in the bipartisan

John McGuire is serving his first term in the House of Representatives representing VirginiaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 5th Congressional District. In the 119th Congress, John serves on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability. As the representative for more than 775,000 Virginia residents, John is focused on keeping costs low for families, protecting and defending the American people and our interests at home and abroad, shrinking the size and scope of the federal government, and supporting a robust and reliable infrastructure system and agriculture base.
John was born and raised in Central Virginia. As a child, he was abandoned and spent his early childhood years in the foster care system, attending nine different elementary schools. By the grace of God, his grandparents rescued him and his older sister from the foster care system and raised them until their dad obtained sobriety. John is incredibly proud of his father John J. McGuire, Jr. who saw one son promoted to brigadier general in the Virginia National Guard, celebrated his 41st anniversary of sobriety, and saw John McGuire, III, elected to Congress in a five-day period of November 2024.

 set his sights on becoming a Navy SEAL in high school. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ He immediately enlisted in the United States Navy after and obtained his dream. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ He spent 10 years as a Navy SEAL, became a sniper, did several deployments to countries across the world defending our nation against evil, and became a sniper instructor before returning home to Virginia.
Back in his hometown in Central Virginia, John founded his small business, SEAL Team PT, Inc., a fitness organization dedicated to helping teams and individuals become stronger, healthier, and more confident. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ John and his team have trained individuals, companies, and sports teams around the country and overseas. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ His company has been part of eighteen division one championships. John has mentored nine young men who have become Navy SEALs as well as others who became Air Force PJs, Army Special forces, MARSOC, pilots, Secret Service agents, and more.
In 2018, John was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, where he quickly developed a reputation as a conservative leader in consensus building and problem solving. Six years later, John was elected to the Virginia State Senate where he served on the Local Government Committee, the Privileges and Elections Committee, and the Transportation Committee. In that time, he led efforts to pass legislation to allow elementary, middle, and high school nurses to store and administer naloxone in response to the opioid crisis. Additionally, he passed legislation to decrease taxes on Virginia veteran retirement pay during a period of divided government.
John and his wife, Tracy have raised five children and now live in Goochland, Virginia.

Congressman Eugene Vindman proudly represents the Seventh District of Virginia which stretches across eleven localities in the central and northern areas of the Commonwealth.
When he was 4 years old, Eugene came with his family to the U.S. as refugees fleeing Soviet Ukraine with less than $800 in their pockets. Eugene grew up in New York where he attended public schools and public university before receiving his ROTC commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. Army.
In the Army, he served as an infantry officer and paratrooper including assignments in the 82D Airborne Division and as a company commander leading troops. Soon after, he transitioned to the U.S. Army Judge Advocate Generals (JAG) Corps. As a JAG, Eugene served as an international law advisor in Iraq; as the senior prosecutor in the busiest jurisdiction in the Army; and as a White House National Security Council (NSC) deputy legal advisor. He attained the rank of Colonel before retiring in 2022 after 25 years of service.

He and his wife Cindy have raised their son and daughter in Dale City, Virginia where their children attend public schools.

Congressman Michael Baumgartner is currently serving his first term in the U.S. House of Representatives where he represents the people of Washington StateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 5th Congressional District. Spanning an expansive area from Canada in the north to Oregon in the south and Idaho to the east, the district includes ten counties, making it the second-largest district in the state.
Raised among the Palouse wheat fields in Colton and Pullman, Washington, Michael is a proud graduate of Washington State University where he earned a degree in economics. He later earned a MasterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs in Public Administration (MPA) with a focus on International Development from Harvard University.
Before coming to Congress, Michael served as a Washington State Senator, diplomat, and as the Treasurer of Spokane County. During his eight years in the State Senate, Michael was instrumental in advancing key initiatives, including the ""Drain the Swamp"" legislation, which successfully eliminated five state agencies to reduce government waste and inefficiency. Over the years, he has received numerous awards, su
---
---
ch as the ""Champion of Freedom Award"" from the Washington Policy Center and the ""Legislator of the Year"" award from the Inland Empire Society of American Foresters.
From 2007 to 2008, Michael served as a U.S. State Department officer at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, and later worked as a counternarcotics advisor on a U.S. government-funded program in Afghanistan, where he met his wife, Eleanor.
Living in Spokane with Eleanor and their five children, Michael and his family are actively involved in his community through youth sports, scouts, and Sunday School.

Born and raised in WashingtonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 6th Congressional District, Emily Randall is the proud product of a union, working-class familyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂlike many in the 6th District.
Emily is fueled by her familyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs experiences. When her sister Olivia, born with complex disabilities, received access to newly expanded Medicaid, Emily became a fierce advocate for quality, affordable healthcare. And as the first in her family to attend a four-year college, Emily knows the importance of education that aligns with the communityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs needs and leads to family-wage jobs.
EmilyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs legislative track record proves she doesnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt just talk the talk, she gets results and wins the toughest races. In 2018 and 2022, Emily won the most competitive state senate district in Washington by focusing on the most important issues and her track record of success.
In Congress, Emily will fight for affordable and accessible healthcare, including reproductive freedom for all; common-sense gun reform; a just transition to a green economy; and affordable education, job training, and apprenticeship programs. EmilyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ready to go beyond partisan politics and focus on the practical solutions that address the dynami

About Me
Elected in 2016, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal is now serving her fifth term in Congress representing WashingtonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 7th District, which encompasses most of Seattle and its surrounding areas including Shoreline, Vashon Island, Lake Forest Park, and parts of Burien and Normandy Park. She is the first South Asian American woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and one of only two dozen naturalized citizens currently serving in the United States Congress.
Congresswoman Jayapal is a member of the House Judiciary Committee, where she serves as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement.

sian Pacific Asian Caucus; and a Vice Chair of the Congressional LGBTQ Equality Caucus where she is the co-chair of the Transgender Equality Task Force.
In Congress, Representative Jayapal has been a leader on immigration, including fighting the Trump AdministrationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs inhumane policies of separating children from their parents and crafting legislation to create a fair and humane immigration system. She has also championed legislation to address income inequality, such as the $15 minimum wage and expanded collective bargaining rights for workers. She has worked extensively on health care issues as the lead sponsor of the Medicare for All bill in the House, and she is the author of the College for All Act, which would ensure every American has access to higher education.

Congresswoman Kim Schrier represents WashingtonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 8th Congressional District, which includes much of King, Pierce, Kittitas, Chelan, and Snohomish Counties, and a small portion of Douglas County.
Prior to being elected to Congress on November 6, 2018, Kim spent her career as a pediatrician in Issaquah, working with children across the Puget Sound region and helping families navigate the health care system. In Congress, Kim uses this expertise to inform her work on issues that improve the lives, health, and wellbeing of children.
As the first pediatrician in Congress, Kim brings a critical voice to issues related to health care. Through her own experience as a patient living with Type 1 diabetes, Kim understands the very real fear of health care costs and access for people living with pre-existing conditions. And as a physician who has worked in a broken health care system, Kim understands what changes 
---
---
need to be made to make it work better for both patients and providers.
Kim grew up the daughter of a public school teacher and an engineer. Her father, an engineer, instilled in Kim a love for science, a passion that led Kim to a degree in Astrophysics at U.C. Berkeley and then to medical school. Her mother taught her the value of education and teachers, and the importance of unions and collective bargaining. As a child, Kim watched her motherÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs union successfully negotiate for increased school funding, smaller class size, and improved benefits.
The product of public education from elementary through medical school, Kim is passionate about helping every child thrive in school. After graduating from U.C. Berkeley Phi Beta Kappa, Kim spent a year working at the EPA before attending medical school at U.C. Davis School of Medicine. She completed her residency at the Lucile Packard ChildrenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Hospital at Stanford University. In 2013, Kim was named Best Pediatrician in the Greater Seattle Area by Parents Map Magazine.
KimÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs experience as a pediatrician gives her a unique understanding of the needs and struggles facing 8th District families. She lives in Sammamish with her husband, David, and son, Sam.

HOME-GROWN LEADERSHIP
Adam Smith was born on June 15, 1965, in Washington, D.C. Adam was raised in SeaTac, Washington where his father, Ben, worked as a ramp serviceman at SeaTac Airport and was active in the local MachinistsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Union. His mother, Leila, stayed at home, raising Adam and his two brothers. Adam attended Bow Lake Elementary, Chinook Middle School, and Tyee High School, graduating from Tyee in 1983.
After a year at Western Washington Universit

y, Adam transferred to Fordham University, where he worked his way through college loading trucks for United Parcel Service and graduated in 1987 with a degree in Political Science. Following his graduation, Adam attended the University Of Washington School Of Law, and earned his law degree in 1990. He later worked in both private and public practice, first as a lawyer at Cromwell, Mendoza and Belur in 1992, and then as a prosecutor for the City of Seattle from 1993-1995. As a prosecutor, Adam focused on drunk driving and domestic violence cases, and in 1996, went on to work as a judge pro tempore.
During his final year at UW, Adam decided to run for the State Senate in the 33rd Legislative District, where he grew up. He campaigned door to door, eventually doorbelling the entire district twice and defeating the 16 year incumbent in the 1990 election. When he took office in January 1991, Adam was 25 years old and the youngest State Senator in the country. While in the State Senate, Adam served on the Education and Law and Justice Committees, and served as Chair of the Law and Justice Committee from 1993-1997. Despite the strong Republican tide in 1994, Adam was re-elected to the State Senate in 1994 and his victory helped the Democrats retain control of the State Senate by one seat. During his time in the State Senate, Adam developed a reputation for having a thoughtful and common sense approach to governance.
WORK IN CONGRESS
The middle and working-class families no longer have access to the same opportunities that they did just decades ago, and these inequities in our economy have been exacerbated by the economic recession as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A central driver of this ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂsqueezing outÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ effect is income inequality, which is now as high as itÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs been since

 the 1930s. Adam's top priority is to encourage broad-based economic opportunity by ensuring all Americans have access to a high-quality education and job-training opportunities, building a stronger transportation infrastructure, reforming our tax code, and supporting social programs that provide a bridge for struggling families to get back to work. These efforts are necessary to restore the American Dream with a pathway to a middle class life for American families.
Adam also understands the importance of passing comprehensive immigration reform.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  He has been a strong voice in Congress advocating for the House of Representatives to pass legislation that creates a pathway to citizenship.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  For too long our immigration system has been broken and it continues to rip families apart. Adam has also been leader in developing new legislation to reform deportation and detention policies.
Adam serves as
Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Committee
, where he is a strong advocate for our military personnel and their families. Adam is also committed to providing our military personnel with the best equipment available to carry out their current and future missions while ensuring that the Pentagon spends taxpayer dollars in the most efficient and effective manner. This includes carefully examining our current policies and working to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse.
Having served on the House Armed Services Committee since he started in Congress, Adam formerly chaired the Subcommittee on Air and Land Forces (ALF), which had jurisdiction over all Army and nearly all Air Force acquisition programs. Prior to serving as Chair of ALF, Adam chaired the Terrorism, Unconventional Threats and Capabilities subcommittee, which oversaw the United States Special Operations Forces and coun

ter-terrorism policy, among other critical areas. Adam has also previously served on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
Given his current and previous committee assignments and extensive travel, Adam has unique insights into todayÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs foremost national security issues throughout the Middle East, including the war in Afghanistan, as well as Northern Africa and our larger efforts to stop the spread of violent extremist groups and their ideology around the globe. Understanding the need for a holistic approach to national security, Adam recognizes the importance of poverty reduction, access to education, sustainable global markets, diplomatic engagement, good governance and other measures to enable our pursuit of stable international partners.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  As such, he has been a long-time advocate of strengthening American diplomacy and development as well as defense.
Adam sees a clear need to reform our foreign assistance and improve these two pillars of national security that have been under-resourced and underutilized for too long. He has supported efforts to reform American foreign assistance, introduced legislation to address global poverty, and created the bipartisan
Congressional Caucus for Effective Foreign Assistance
(CCEFA) with former Congressman Ander Crenshaw. In the 116th Congress, Congressman Smith now co-chairs the Caucus with Congressman Ted Yoho (R-FL). The Caucus has been expanded to the Senate under the leadership of Senators Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Chris Coons (D-ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ DE).

Congressman Riley M. Moore represents West Virginia's Second District in the U.S. House of Representatives. He sits on the House Appropriations Committee.
Congressman Moore started his career as a welder in a mining operation, and later went on to earn degrees from George Mason University and the National Defense University. He has served as a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates and most recently as the 25th State Treasurer of West Virginia.
While State Treasurer, Congressman Moore fought back against radical anti-fossil fuel ESG policies in the financial services industry. He was the first elected official in America to divest West Virginia tax dollars from BlackRock over their support for ESG. Subsequently, he helped build a coalition of a dozen other states who worked collaboratively to push back on ESG's undue influence in the financial marketplace.
As Treasurer, Congressman Moore also helped pass and administer both the
Hope Scholarship Program
and the
Jumpstart Savings Program
.
A native of Morgantown, he now lives with his wife Mina and their three children in Harper's Ferry.

About Bryan  
Image  
First elected in 2018, Congressman Bryan Steil represents Wisconsin's First Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.  
Bryan has earned a reputation for working hard for Wisconsin during his first two terms in Congress. Being available and accessible to residents and listening to their concerns has been a top priority. To hear directly from residents, Bryan regularly holds in-person town halls across the First District as well as numerous telephone town halls. He utilizes his office to help local families. In 2022 alone, he helped more than 2,000 constituents receive assistance with federal agencies such as the Social Security Administration, VA, and Medicare. In addition, Bryan has held numerous public forums for our community regarding illicit fentanyl,  
children's mental health  
,  
robocalls and scams prevention  
, and the  
impact of trade deals on Wisconsin dairy and ag

.
In 2023, Bryan was appointed Chairman of the Committee on House Administration. This committee oversees Federal election law, House of Representatives operations, Legislative Branch oversight, and Capitol Security. Bryan is focused on ensuring the House is open, secure, and accountable to the American people, and on strengthening Americans trust in our elections. Bryan previously served as Ranking Member on the Elections Subcommittee.
In the 117
th
Congress, Bryan served as the Ranking Member of the Select Committee on the Economy. This committee evaluated the root causes of economic hardship in our country, and Bryan worked to address these issues and create opportunity and prosperity for all Americans.
Bryan is a problem solver with extensive private sector experience who puts politics aside and focuses on issues impacting Wisconsin. Previously, Bryan served as the co-chair of the
Middle Class Jobs Caucus
, where he worked to fill the skills gap, improve access to education, and ensure families have the opportunity to succeed. Bryan also served as the co-chair of the
Future of Work Caucus
to ensure workers have the skills and education to fill tomorrow's jobs. In this role, Bryan brings together industry leaders from our community to meet with caucus members in Washington, D.C. and work on real world solutions to the problems facing America.
As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, Bryan is focused on making the American dream achievable for everyone. He is working to bring family sustaining jobs to our communities by increasing investments in Southeast Wisconsin. For example, he authored the
Expanding Investment in Small Businesses Act of 2019
, which passed the House in July of 2019 by a vote of 417-2. This bill helps entrepreneurs obtain c

apital, hire workers, and create jobs right here in Wisconsin. Steil also founded the Investing in Innovation Initiative, a caucus to promote opportunities that support investment in small businesses and opportunities for wealth creation.
Bryan is focused on keeping our communities safe. He has built a coalition of 50 Members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats, and local law enforcement in Southeast Wisconsin to shine a light on the problem of human trafficking. Bryan's bill, the Exposing the
Financing of Human Trafficking Act
, holds countries accountable and gets them to investigate, prevent, and prosecute financial criminal acts associated with human trafficking. In addition, Bryan is
leading an effort
to ensure Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon and enforce U.S. sanctions on European countries that trade with Iran.
Prior to being elected to Congress, Bryan spent a decade working in Wisconsin's manufacturing industry - first with an industrial motion control manufacturer in Beloit, WI and later at a local plastics manufacturer in Milton, WI. In the private sector, he saw firsthand how burdensome federal regulations and red tape can hinder economic growth and job creation in Wisconsin. He also learned the importance of fighting for common sense solutions.
In 2016, Bryan was appointed by the Governor of Wisconsin and unanimously confirmed in the Wisconsin Senate to serve on the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents. As a Regent, he helped oversee the 26 UW system campuses, their 170,000 students, and a six billion dollar budget. He was known as a fiscal hawk dedicated to working for students and families. For example, Bryan supported initiatives that froze tuition to ensure all students had the opportunity to obtain an affordable high quality education.
