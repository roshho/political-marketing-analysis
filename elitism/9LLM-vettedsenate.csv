SN017,"Shaheen, Jeanne",New Hampshire,Democratic,II,SH-506,Shaheen,Shaheen.senate.gov/about/,"About
The first woman in U.S. history to be elected both a Governor and a United States Senator, New HampshireÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Jeanne Shaheen is a trailblazer with a reputation for working across the aisle to get things done.
Senator Shaheen is committed to serving the citizens of New Hampshire and is known for her common-sense leadership, hard work and dedication to improving the lives of the middle class. She has served in the Senate since 2009 and is a member of the Senate Committees on Armed Services, Foreign Relations, Appropriations, Small Business and Entrepreneurship and the Select Committee on Ethics.

As a former small business owner, Senator Shaheen knows how tough it can be for entrepreneurs, who often operate on razor thin profit margins. On the Small Business Committee, sheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs expanded small businessesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ access to credit and markets. Her annual Experience New Hampshire event in Washington, D.C., gives New Hampshire businesses a forum to showcase their products and services to policymakers and government officials. Shaheen continues to lead efforts in the Senate to protect New Hampshire businesses from having to unfairly collect internet sales taxes for other states.

The opioid epidemic is the worst public health crisis in New HampshireÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs history, and Senator Shaheen has made fighting this crisis her number one priority in Congress. Through her leadership on the Appropriations committee, Senator Shaheen worked to deliver a seven fold increase in resources to help Granite Staters suffering from substance use disorders receive desperately needed treatment. She works across the aisle to provide tools that treatment providers, law enforcement and first responders need to deliver lifesaving services.

Shaheen helped pass the Affordable Care Act, and has defended the law from partisan attacks, ensuring that tens of thousands of Granite Staters can keep their health care. The law drastically expanded the availability of drug treatment in New Hampshire through Medicaid Expansion, a vital tool to address the opioid crisis, and provided protections to people with pre-existing conditions. She continues to lead efforts in the Senate to advance common-sense health care legislation that would expand access to care and lower the costs of both treatment and prescription drugs. 

Serving Granite Staters in the United States Senate.

As top ranking woman of the Armed Services committee and the Ranking Member of the Foreign Relations committee, Senator Shaheen advocates for a strong foreign policy that confronts our enemies, strengthens key alliances, and bolsters New HampshireÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs role in our national defense. ShaheenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs strong stance against Vladimir PutinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs aggression, led to her being sanctioned by the Kremlin and denied a visa to travel to Russia. Shaheen is a leader on protecting our democratic institutions from foreign intrusion, enhancing our cyber defenses, and working with our allies to improve trade and security cooperation. She has been a consistent advocate for the critical role the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Pease Air National Guard Base and New Hampshire's defense-related companies, serve in protecting our nation.

Senator Shaheen is a champion for women here at home and around the globe. In 2018, she worked to broaden the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in order to better investigate and prosecute violent crimes against women. In 2016, President Obama signed into law the Shaheen-authored Sexual Assault SurvivorsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Rights Act, a federal bill of rights for sexual assault survivors. Jeanne Shaheen has also been a consistent supporter of Planned Parenthood and the critical health services it provides to thousands of Granite Staters. She has led bipartisan efforts in Congress to permanently repeal the Trump administrationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs expanded Global Gag Rule, which undermines the availability of family planning and other health care services in developing countries, and got legislation signed into law that gives women a seat at the table to better facilitate lasting conflict resolution around the world.

New Hampshire is the only state in the nation without a full service VA hospital.  To expand health services for veterans, Shaheen worked with members of both parties to pass VA reforms enabling Granite State veterans to receive quality health care outside the VA system and closer to home.

Senator Shaheen has made streamlining government and fiscal responsibility a hallmark of her career in the Senate, identifying many areas of waste and inefficiency. She has introduced bipartisan legislation to reform the congressional budget process, eliminate duplicative programs, and phase out unneeded and costly tax breaks for sugar growers and mining companies. She has also led efforts to eliminate exorbitant subsidies for powerful special interests like pharmaceutical and oil companies.

Shaheen recognizes the severity of the environmental and economic threat that climate change poses to New Hampshire and the world. She supports smart energy policies that will curb carbon pollution and preserve New HampshireÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs way of life. As a champion for energy efficiency, Shaheen created programs while Governor that saved New Hampshire families and businesses over $1 billion. In the Senate, Shaheen has worked across the aisle in Congress to pass national energy efficiency legislation which was signed into law by President Obama. Further, Shaheen has established a goal of more than 50 percent clean and carbon-free electricity by 2030.

Senator Shaheen has a reputation for outstanding constituent services. She and her staff have successfully helped thousands of constituents navigate bureaucracy, avoid foreclosure, secure military commendations, receive delayed Social Security and Medicare assistance and access VA benefits, among many other services.

SN022,"Schiff, Adam B.",California,Democratic,I,SH-112,Schiff,Schiff.senate.gov/about/,"Early Days
Adam was born in Framingham, Massachusetts to Edward and Sherrill Ann Schiff. His father was a clothing salesman and the family ultimately moved to the East Bay ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Alamo, California ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ in search of the California dream. Adam graduated from DanvilleÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Monte Vista High School in the Bay Area, and went on to both Stanford University and Harvard Law School.

Adam and his wife, Eve, have two wonderful children and have been married for almost 30 years.

Serving Californians

In 1996, Adam was elected to the California State Senate, and when his term began, he was the SenateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs youngest member. During his four-year term, Adam chaired the the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Senate Public Employment and Retirement Committee, the Senate Select Committee on Juvenile Justice, and the Joint Committee on the Arts. While serving in the State Senate, Adam also was a professor teaching political science at Glendale Community College.
As a state legislator, Adam authored dozens of bills that were signed into law by both Democratic and Republican governors, including measures guaranteeing up-to-date textbooks in the classroom, overhauling state child support laws, passing a patientÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs bill of rights, and guaranteeing cost-of-living increases for teacher pensions. He also authored the Schiff-CÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡rdenas Juvenile Justice Crime Prevention Act of 2000, which provided millions in funding to keep at-risk youth out of prison. Adam is also known as the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂFather of the Gold LineÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ for his work to expand Metro rail into the San Gabriel valley, from Pasadena to Azusa, a project that is still ongoing.

In 2000, Adam was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served as a member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the House Appropriations Committee. He also served as Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and as a member of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol, and the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi.

In 2024, Adam was elected to the United States Senate to represent the state of California.






Championing Local Priorities
AdamÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs top priority is to make the economy work for everyone ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ especially working families and the middle class. He has introduced numerous bills to bring down the cost of housing by building it faster and cheaper, to address homelessness and get people off the streets and into shelter, to expand affordable childcare, to reduce the cost of food and fuel and to raise incomes by supporting collective bargaining.

Adam has always believed that small businesses are the true engine of growth, and he continues to fight to enact tax relief for small businesses, to create good-paying jobs, and to restore America as a manufacturing powerhouse. He was an early advocate for the expansion of Medi-Cal to ensure low-income children and families, pregnant women, and people with disabilities have access to free or low-cost quality health care in the state of California. Adam also is a supporter of universal healthcare and continues to fight for expanded access to health care for all.

Adam is a longtime champion of the environment and clean energy, as well as investments in infrastructure and mass transit. In Congress, Adam has led efforts to extend light rail and mass transit throughout Los Angeles County. Adam has pushed for an Apollo Project-level investment in fighting climate change, investing in clean energy and creating millions of new, green jobs and a green economy in California and across the country. Throughout his time in Congress, Adam has pushed to preserve and protect natural spaces, like protecting the Rim of the Valley Corridor by adding almost 200,000 acres to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area to protect natural resources and habitats around the Los Angeles basin for generations to come. 





Adam has also been a leading advocate for equality and human rights at home and around the world. He has led efforts in Congress to officially recognize the Armenian Genocide and in 2019 the U.S. Congress passed AdamÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs resolution with overwhelming bipartisan support, ending decades of shameful silence on the issue. Adam has also been a leading voice against RussiaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs invasion of Ukraine and their foreign interference in our elections. 

As a former federal prosecutor, Schiff has worked to improve public safety and end the scourge of gun violence, with an emphasis on smart, cost-effective solutions, as well as a leader pushing for criminal justice reform. Adam obtained federal funding to create a Foothills Regional DNA Lab in Glendale to speed the processing of DNA evidence in Glendale, Burbank, Pasadena, and other foothill cities and take violent offenders off the street. Adam also brought millions back to Los Angeles to address the rape-kit backlog and bring violent sex offenders to justice. He also introduced the Equal Access to Justice for Victims of Gun Violence Act to ensure the gun industry is not shielded from liability when it acts negligently, and victims of gun violence get their day in court. He has also been a leading proponent in Congress for the Justice Reinvestment Initiative, a program that helps states reduce spending on incarceration while reinvesting the savings in public safety and community investments.  

Adam has long-championed investments in new technology and space exploration, which has fueled his belief that American leadership in space exploration is a key economic driver in tech and emerging industries. Adam has fought hard to preserve and expand the robotic missions from missions to Mars to a mission to JupiterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs moon of Europa. And closer to home, he has secured over $100 million in federal funding to build out the West Coast Earthquake Early Warning system, which provides Californians a warning prior to the arrival of a destructive earthquake.

Upholding And Strengthening Democracy
Adam is committed to upholding and strengthening our democracy and the rule of law. He led the House impeachment inquiry and served as the Lead Impeachment Manager during the first Senate impeachment trial of President Donald J. Trump. He also served as a member of the January 6th Select Committee.


Adam has worked to harden our defenses against foreign interference in our elections. He has championed the Protecting Our Democracy Act, landmark legislation to prevent the abuse of power by any president and to strengthen checks and balances. He has also fought to strengthen our democracy by championing expansion of voting rights for all Americans, and legislation to expand and protect the rights of all Americans, including women and LGBTQ individuals whose rights have been under assault. 



As the former chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Adam is recognized as a leader on national security and foreign policy issues. He has been a longtime advocate of legislation to sunset out of date Authorizations to Use Military Force and to refocus AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs counterterrorism mission. Adam has advanced efforts to protect the freedom of the press by authoring the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act, as well as successful legislation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear material.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schiff,8-Dec-24,Stanford University,Harvard University,,,,1,1,0,0,0,"Adam graduated from DanvilleÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Monte Vista High School in the Bay Area, and went on to both Stanford University and Harvard Law School.

I will do everything I can to support the needs of all Mississippians, and strive to justify the confidence that has been placed in me as your Senator.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

Official Photo of Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith

U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith is a public servant committed to conservative principles as she works for all Mississippians.  She is the first woman elected to represent Mississippi in Washington, D.C.  She won a six-year term in November 2020, following her April 2018 appointment to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by long-time U.S. Senator Thad Cochran and subsequent November 2018 special election victory to complete his term.

In the 119th Congress, Hyde-Smith serves on a number of key Senate committees, including the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and the Committee on Rules and Administration. 

As Senator, Hyde-Smith is a leading voice for Mississippians, working to improve the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs economy and quality of life.  She has used her committee roles to support policies and legislation that benefit both the state and nation.  Her successful efforts in the legislative process include championing initiatives that support economic growth in Mississippi, including fighting for the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs agricultural sector, infrastructure development, job training and educational programs, rural healthcare, energy development, shipbuilding industry, and defense and aerospace sectors.

The first bill she introduced as a Senator in 2018ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe Migratory Bird Framework and Hunting Opportunities for Veterans Act to extend duck season to January 31 and establish a special weekend for youth, veterans, and active militaryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂultimately became law in March 2019 as part of a larger legislative package.  Senator Hyde-Smith remains a strong advocate for defending the constitutional Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.

In her role on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, Hyde-Smith has worked diligently to secure funding and resources for key priorities in Mississippi.  Her efforts have centered around shipbuilding, defense, agriculture, rural health, small business, transportation infrastructure, flood control and disaster response, and other priority issues. 

As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Hyde-Smith is a leading voice for American agriculture and rural communities.  She worked successfully to secure emergency assistance for the economically-strapped agricultural sector in the American Relief Act, 2025.  Having influenced the crafting and passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, which included provisions she authored pertaining to rural economic development, better crop insurance for flood-prone regions, Chronic Wasting Disease research, and forest health, Senator Hyde-Smith is now dedicated to the passage of a 2025 Farm Bill to update the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs policies to meet current challenges to agriculture.

In early 2019, Senator Hyde-Smith took decisive action to address the catastrophic flooding in the Yazoo Backwater Area, eventually helping to get the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to agree on a final plan to finally move toward construction of a flood control project first authorized in 1941.  Hyde-Smith is committed to continuing to work on the backwater pumps issue, including securing funding for Corps of Engineers build and maintain its extensive flood control projects throughout Mississippi.

A committed social conservative, Hyde-Smith continues to lead the Senate Pro-Life Caucus, fighting to protect the sanctity of life and opposing efforts to expand mail-order abortions.

Hyde-Smith established herself as a leader in support for rural healthcare, helping to secure funding to support rural hospitals and resources to expand telehealth for Medicare beneficiaries.  She led the successful bipartisan effort to establish an Office of Rural Health within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Senator Hyde-Smith has toiled to address the serious health issues affecting many Mississippians, advocating for better treatments and support for juvenile diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. 

Prior to becoming a U.S. Senator for Mississippi, Hyde-Smith served as the Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce, elected in 2011 and reelected in 2015.

As Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce, Hyde-Smith worked to ensure fairness and equity in the marketplace and protect Mississippians through sound regulatory practices.  Highlights of her tenure were her efforts to reopen foreign markets for American beef exports, advocate for country-of-origin food labeling, and ensure that imported catfish meet USDA food safety standards.  Under her leadership, the department was recognized as a ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂmodel agencyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ for effectiveness and budget control.  Hyde-Smith held agency spending growth to less than two percent her entire tenure.

Before leading the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce, Hyde-Smith served 12 years in the Mississippi State Senate, including eight years as chairman of the Agriculture Committee.  As a legislator, Hyde-Smith championed policies to promote and protect all facets of the agriculture industry.  She fought to protect private property rights, supported tort reform, and earned respect for her advocacy of conservative budget and pro-business initiatives.

As a U.S. Senator, Hyde-Smith has received the Award for Conservative Achievement from the American Conservative Union Foundation, the Spirit of Enterprise Award from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the Champion of Small Business Award from the National Federation of Independent Business.  Among other commendations, the National Rural Health Association gave the Senator its Rural Health Champion Award, and she received National Legislator of the Year honors from the Mississippi Rural Health Association. 

Additionally, Hyde-Smith has received the Friend of the Farm Bureau Award from the American Farm Bureau Federation, the Agricultural Legislator of the Year Award from the Mississippi Association of Conservation Districts, the Ambassador Award from the Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation, the Achievement Award from Delta Council, and the Outstanding Service to Small Farmers Award from Alcorn State University.

A member of U.S. Senate since 2012, Senator Heinrich serves as the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. Senator Heinrich plays a role that allows him to promote policies that foster job creation through innovation and encourage the use of energy efficient technology. The committee consists of members from both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives and helps provide citizens and lawmakers with critical information on the health of the U.S. economy and often examines how government can better work for the middle class. 

Senator Heinrich serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee and as chairman of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, which oversees funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, except for the U.S. Forest Service, the Farm Credit Administration, and the Food and Drug Administration. Senator Heinrich also serves on the following Appropriations Subcommittees: Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies; Energy and Water Development; Financial Services and General Government; and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies (MILCON). 

As the previous chairman of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies subcommittee, Heinrich has fought to ensure our military installations have all the modern facilities they need to execute their national security missions, and to secure all the resources and funding the VA needs to keep America's promise to our service members and their families when they return home as veterans. 

An avid sportsman and conservationist, Heinrich works to protect New MexicoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs public lands, watersheds, and wildlife for future generations. He worked with local communities to designate the RÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ­o Grande del Norte and Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monuments.

With its abundance of solar and wind resources and energy research hubs, New Mexico can lead the way in combating the devastating effects of climate change and modernizing our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs electrical grid. In 2015, Heinrich helped negotiate the long-term extension of renewable energy tax credits that support New MexicoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs growing clean energy industries. Heinrich introduced legislation to prepare New MexicoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs workforce for good-paying clean energy jobs. He has also supported the development of renewable energy projects on public and tribal lands, the adoption of innovative energy storage and battery technologies, and improvement to the security of our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs energy infrastructure.

To build a brighter economic future, Heinrich believes in investments in communities and the next generation of New Mexicans. Heinrich supports major investments in early childhood education, public schools, and health care. He introduced the bipartisan Two Generation Economic Empowerment Act to help states like New Mexico coordinate programs across human services, workforce development, education, and health care agencies so they can work more effectively to put parents and children on the path to success.

He is one of a few dozen people in American history to have served as a Mayor, Governor and United States Senator.
Early Commitment to Public Service
Tim grew up working in his fatherÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ironworking shop in Kansas City. His parents taught him the value of hard work and showed him how small businesses and technical skills strengthen this country every day. After graduating from the University of Missouri, Tim started his public service career by running a technical school founded by Jesuit missionaries in Honduras. He trained teenagers to become carpenters and welders, equipping them with skills to lift up themselves and their communities. As Tim says, his work in Honduras was ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂa North StarÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ that led to his commitment to advance job opportunities for everyone. His time there reinforced three core values that are still a central part of his life today: ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂFÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¨, familia, y trabajoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂFaith, family, and work.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ


Family Life
Tim met Virginian Anne Holton at Harvard Law School and they married in 1984 in the same church in Richmond they attend to this day. They have three adult children. Anne, a former legal aid lawyer and juvenile court judge, served as Virginia Secretary of Education from 2014 until 2016. Before that, Anne ran Great Expectations, a program that offers tutoring, career coaching, and other services to help young adults aging out of foster care and attending Virginia community colleges transition to successful, independent adulthood. She now teaches education policy at George Mason University after having served as its interim President in 2019-2020 ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Tim calls her the best public servant he knows. AnneÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs father Linwood Holton, a former Republican Governor of Virginia, was critical to integrating VirginiaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs public schools, putting the Commonwealth on the path to progress we see today.


Early Career
After law school, Tim practiced law in Richmond for 17 years, specializing in the representation of people who had been denied housing due to their race, disability, or family status. In 1998, Tim helped win one of the largest civil rights jury verdicts ever in a case involving discrimination against minority neighborhoods by an insurance company. He also began teaching law part-time at the University of Richmond in 1987.


Elected Office
Tim was first elected to office in 1994, serving as a city council member and four years later, Mayor of Richmond. When he was first elected to City Council in Richmond, the city had one of the highest homicide rates in America, and he worked with law enforcement and the community to find solutions that brought down the rate of violent crime. He became Lieutenant Governor of Virginia in 2002 and was inaugurated as VirginiaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 70th Governor in 2006. While serving as Governor, Tim improved the education and health care systems, and by the end of his term, leading publications ranked Virginia the best state to raise a child and the best state for business. He visited a school in every county and city in the Commonwealth and helped Virginia make it through the worst recession since the Great Depression. He also responded to the tragic shooting at Virginia Tech by strengthening VirginiaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs background check system and pushing his legislature to do more to make communities safer. At the request of President Obama, Kaine served as Chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 2009 through 2011 where he rallied Democrats around the nation to support passage of the Affordable Care Act.


In the Senate
Tim was elected to the Senate in 2012 as a can-do optimist skilled in bringing people together across old lines of party, race, or region.

Tim has spent his time in the Senate focused on improving the lives of Virginians. He has made boosting job opportunities for everyone a top priority. As co-chair of the bipartisan Career and Technical Education (CTE) Caucus, Tim focuses on expanding access to job-training programs to ensure that students of all ages are prepared with the skills they need for the jobs of the modern economy. Tim has helped lead efforts in the Senate to reduce unemployment for military families and veterans.

As a member of the Armed Services Committee, a Senator from one of the states most closely connected to the military, and the father of a former Marine, Tim is focused on crafting smart defense strategy and reducing the risk of unnecessary war. He works to ensure that the military has the resources it needs to keep the country safe and that servicemembers and veterans receive the benefits and care they have earned. He has also been the leading voice against Presidents starting wars without a vote by Congress.

Tim believes that health care is a right, not something reserved just for those who can afford it. He has introduced legislation to expand access to quality, affordable health care and lower health care costs for Americans. He has led the fight to protect young people from harmful tobacco products and successfully passed legislation raising the federal tobacco purchase age from 18 to 21. He introduced and successfully pushed for passage of the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act, legislation to prevent burnout, suicide, and mental and behavioral health issues among health care workers, which was signed into law in March 2022. He's also introduced legislation to give Americans more options for affordable health insurance, to lower the cost of prescription drugs, and to combat the opioid epidemic.  

Tim works on those priorities every day for Virginians as a member of the Senate Armed Services; Budget; Foreign Relations; and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committees.

In 2022, the CHIPS and Science Act, his landmark legislation to outcompete China and create more high tech jobs in the Heartland, became law. Vital to AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs economic and national security, the law is bringing semiconductor production back to the United States to shore up our supply chain and ensure America is never dependent on China for critical chips.

ToddÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs path to the Senate went through the United States Marine Corps.

In 2003, Todd returned home to Indiana. He worked for several years as a management consultant, advising public and private organizations on how they could implement business practices to provide their constituents and customers with more value, often by investing fewer resources. 

Soon after returning to Indiana, Todd met his future wife, Jenny, while earning his JD from Indiana University. They married in 2005, and then worked together at a small law firm in Paoli, Indiana, that was started by JennyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs great-grandfather in 1933.

Senator Fischer was first elected to the U.S. Senate in November 2012, becoming the first Nebraska woman elected to a full term and the first Nebraska state senator elected directly after service in the state legislature. Six years later, in November 2018, Nebraskans voted overwhelmingly to send her back to the U.S. Senate for a second term.

Senator Fischer is committed to working with Republicans and Democrats alike to advance sensible policies that will promote strong Nebraska families and communities.

Senator Fischer believes the first duty of Congress is to defend the nation. As a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, she is committed to defending against growing threats to our homeland and our allies. In her capacity as Chair of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, she is focused on critical issues including our nuclear triad and associated delivery systems, the emergence of space as a warfighting domain, and defending the nation against increasingly sophisticated missile threats. The subcommittee directly oversees two unified combatant commands: U.S. Strategic Command and U.S. Space Command. 

Senator Fischer recently joined the Appropriations Committee, which helps shape the federal governmentÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs spending policies. This position will ensure Nebraskans have greater input into the programs and agencies that directly affect their lives.

Senator Fischer is a Nebraska cattle rancher with over 40 years of real-life experience working with agriculture producers and rural and economic development groups across the state. As NebraskaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs voice on this committee, she works to cut regulations negatively affecting agriculture and open up new trade opportunities for farmers and ranchers.

Senator Fischer is a member of Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnellÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs leadership team, serving as counsel to the Republican Leader. Using this position, which she has held since 2015, she presents the concerns of Nebraskans directly to the Republican Senate leadership.

She was elected in 2024 after serving four terms as DelawareÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs sole representative in the U.S. House of Representatives. In the House, she served on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which oversees health care, the environment, commerce and trade, energy policy, telecommunications, manufacturing, and consumer protection.

Senator Blunt Rochester is a leading voice in Congress on workforce issues, the future of work, and building an economy that works for everyone. As former Secretary of Labor and State Personnel Director, she leverages her expertise to advocate for policies that support growth and ensure working families earn a living wage. She founded and co-chaired the bipartisan Congressional Future of Work Caucus in the House. After seeing the impact of empty grocery shelves during the pandemic, she also led the charge in Congress to address the supply chain crisis and bring manufacturing jobs back to Delaware and the United States.

As a former statewide health official, Senator Blunt Rochester brings a broad perspective on health care policy. She has worked as an implementer at the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services, a negotiator as State Personnel Director, and an advocate as CEO of the Metropolitan Wilmington Urban League.

She has been committed to reducing health care and prescription drug costs for middle-class families, addressing health disparities in communities of color, and combating the opioid and addiction epidemic. When the Heroin epidemic devastated Delaware communities, she acted urgently and became a member of the Bipartisan Heroin and Opioid Task Force, a coalition of over 100 members dedicated to passing critical legislation to combat opioid addiction. Additionally, Senator Blunt Rochester has played a pivotal role in passing landmark legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act and the Telehealth Modernization Act ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ which both work to lower the cost of prescription drugs and increase access to healthcare for AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs seniors and those with disabilities.

A strong advocate for the nursing workforce, she championed the passage of the TRAIN Act, which protected a key nursing education pipeline to address the nursing shortage. Throughout her career, she has fought for underserved communities and is a leader on public health promotion and programs that help Americans live healthier and longer.

In the 115th Congress, Senator Blunt Rochester became the first Delawarean in over 120 years to serve on the House Committee on Agriculture. She played a key role in crafting the 2018 Farm Bill, a five-year reauthorization that supports the farm safety net, nutrition programs for vulnerable populations, land-grant universities, and agricultural research. A champion of criminal justice reform, she introduced the groundbreaking Clean Slate Act, which seals the federal records of nonviolent offenders. This legislation aims to provide individuals with opportunities to secure good-paying jobs, pursue education, and access housing after reentering society. Research uncovered by the Center for American Progress estimates individuals who are shut out of opportunities because of their criminal records costs the U.S. economy up to $87 billion annually. The Clean Slate Act would help boost the national economy while helping these individuals gain good paying jobs.

After hearing concerns from homeowners in North Bethany Beach about an error in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs coastal mapping, Senator Blunt Rochester introduced the Strengthening Coastal Communities Act in her first term, which corrected the error, supported environmental preservation, and became her first bill enacted into law. She has since spearheaded the SHORRE Act to improve coastal resilience up and down DelawareÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs coastlines, so communities and homeowners are protected from rising seas and extreme weather. She authored legislation that invested $100 million to decarbonize the Port of Wilmington. This federal investment came as part of the U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Clean Ports Program in the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed by Congress and signed into law by President Biden in 2022. And in 2024, she co-led the bipartisan Bolstering Ecosystems Against Coastal Harm Act (BEACH Act). This legislation addresses climate-driven risks like flooding, storm surges, and sea level rise by amending and reauthorizing the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) and updating critical coastal maps.

The proud son of immigrants from Mexico, Senator Alex Padilla believes in giving everyone a fair shot at the American dream. A progressive problem solver, Alex has dedicated his career to finding solutions to the toughest challenges and fighting for communities that are too often left out and left behind.

Early Days
Alex Padilla is a lifelong Californian. He was born and raised in the proud, working class community of Pacoima, in the San Fernando Valley. AlexÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs parents immigrated to Los Angeles from different parts of Mexico in the 1960s. Once in California, they met, fell in love, and applied for green cards.

AlexÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs parents had little formal education, but they shared a strong work ethic and big dreams. For forty years, AlexÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs father worked as a short order cook in various Los Angeles diners. For the same forty years, his mom worked cleaning houses. They instilled in Alex, his sister, and his brother the importance of getting a good education as well as the value of service to others. As a result, Alex spent many weekends at community clean-ups and other neighborhood service projects.

College & Education

Alex attended Los Angeles public schools and graduated from San Fernando High School. While his first love was baseball, he also excelled in math and science. With the encouragement of several teachers, he applied and was accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering.


Entrance
into Politics
After graduating from MIT, Alex returned home eager to begin his career. However, a rising tide of anti-immigrant sentiment in California at the time drew Alex towards politics. He knew he had to take a stand against cynical rhetoric demonizing people like his parents, friends, and neighbors. In 1994, Alex joined protests against CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Proposition 187, which sought to deny public benefits to immigrants. He went on to manage political campaigns for several legislative candidates and served as a field representative for Senator Dianne Feinstein.

Career in Public Service

In 1999, at the age of 26, Alex was elected to the Los Angeles City Council to represent the district where he grew up. In 2001, just two years later, he was elected by his colleagues to serve as President of the City CouncilÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe youngest person in city history and the first Latino in over 100 years to hold the position. Alex served as acting Mayor of Los Angeles during the aftermath of 9/11, leading the city through a time of heightened security and tensions. As a council member, he worked to create economic opportunity zones in his district and reduce crime through improved community-police relations.

In 2006, Alex was elected to CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs State Senate, where, over the course of two terms, he became known as one of CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs most effective state legislators. A problem-solver with an ability to build consensus, Alex authored landmark bills requiring nutritional information on restaurant menus, streamlining the process for community college students seeking to transfer to four-year universities, phasing out single-use plastic bags, and mandating the deployment of the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs earthquake early warning system. For six years, he served as Chair of the State Senate Committee on Energy, Utilities, and Communications, where he was instrumental in developing CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs renewable energy and climate policiesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂamong the most ambitious in the worldÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂas well as expanding access to broadband and modernizing CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs electrical grid.

In 2014, Alex was elected California Secretary of State, the first Latino in state history to serve in the office. As Secretary of State, he worked to make elections more accessible and inclusive while protecting the integrity of voting systems. Alex helped establish automatic and same-day voter registration, secured $500 million to upgrade CaliforniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs voting systems to meet higher security standards, and oversaw the implementation of the landmark VoterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Choice Act, which expanded mail-in and in-person early voting. Under AlexÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs leadership, the state reached a record high number of more than 22 million Californians registered to vote and the highest percentage of eligible citizens registered to vote in 80 years.


U.S. Senate & Values
In November of 2022, Alex was elected to the United States Senate. He began serving in January of 2021 after being appointed to fill the vacancy created by the election of Vice President Kamala Harris. He is the first Latino to represent California in the U.S. Senate.

Since being sworn in to office, Padilla has established himself as a champion of voting rights, climate action, and ensuring everyone has a fair shot at the American dream.

Alex is the first Latino to serve as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety. His first bill, the Citizenship for Essential Workers Act, seeks to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who served as government-recognized essential workers in key sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic. He is also a member of the Senate Committees on Budget; Environment and Public Works; Energy and Natural Resources; Judiciary; and Rules.

From growing up in Glen Dale in the Northern Panhandle, to representing the 2nd Congressional District from the Ohio River up to the Eastern Panhandle, to raising her family in Charleston, Shelley knows the ins and outs of every region of the state. Early in life, Shelley saw how her father, Governor Arch Moore Jr., instituted changes to improve West VirginiaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂbuilding up not only infrastructure and the economy but also families and state pride. ItÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs that mindset that inspires her work today.

Public Service
While raising three kids, Shelley became more involved in her local community, representing Kanawha County in the West Virginia House of Delegates. In 2000, she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where she worked to spur growth by supporting community banks and freeing up capital to rural communities. She also worked extensively to expand transportation infrastructure throughout the state, most notably along Route 35. After seven terms representing the Second Congressional District, she ran for the United States Senate, hoping to be a stronger voice for the Mountain State and to restore order to a Senate stuck in gridlock for far too long. Shelley is the first female Senator in West VirginiaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs history and was elected with the largest margin of victory for a Republican in state history in 2020ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwinning more than 70 percent of the vote and all 55 counties, surpassing the previous mark she set in 2014 when she won more than 62 percent of the vote and all 55 counties.

SN027,"Risch, James E.",Idaho,Republican,II,SR-483,Risch,Risch.senate.gov/about/,"About Senator Risch of Idaho
Jim Risch, currently serving a third term as Idaho's 28th Senator, holds a longstanding commitment to public service and a passion for good government. Risch is what his peers call a ""no-nonsense, get-the-job-done leader"" with more than four decades of experience in elected office. He has been recognized by the National Journal as the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂMost ConservativeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Senator in the United States Senate.

Risch brings his results-focused approach to governance to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he serves as ranking member for the 117th Congress. As the lead Republican on the committee, Risch is focused on protecting the security and interests of the American people, in addition to continuing to advance U.S. prosperity and leadership in the world. He is confronting many issues that hit home across Idaho, like advancing the interests of Idaho citizens and businesses in international trade and investment, promoting Idaho exports, guarding Idaho interests in the Columbia River Treaty talks, supporting human rights, and confronting the problem of sex trafficking.

During the 115th Congress, Risch served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship where he successfully passed several initiatives to improve cybersecurity resources for small businesses, cut red tape and reduce regulations, and improve small business access to capital. He remains committed to working for IdahoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs small businesses as a senior member of the committee during the 117th Congress. 

Risch also represents IdahoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs interests on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, giving Idaho a voice in legislation that dramatically shapes the West, and he serves on the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Select Committee on Ethics.

During his service as Idaho's 31st governor, Risch lowered property taxes by 20 percent providing much-needed tax relief to Idaho taxpayers, while setting aside $100 million in a rainy day fund for schools. He also designed a plan to manage Idaho's roadless areas and supervised the adoption of a rule that effectively prohibits the construction of traditional mercury-releasing pulverized coal power plants. Both measures earned Risch bipartisan acclaim for his pragmatic approach to natural resource issues and land management.

As governor, Risch also accomplished a number of initiatives to create a streamlined and effective government. He transformed Idaho's executive office by opening regional offices throughout the state, enhancing communication and responsiveness to Idahoans. Risch also succeeded in a major reorganization of Idaho's Department of Health and Welfare that allowed for more efficient administration and cost savings.

As a twice-elected lieutenant governor, Risch earned a reputation as an advocate for smart economic development. He continues to work with businessesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂnew and old alikeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂto ensure continued prosperity for the people and places of Idaho. 

Senator Risch began his career in public service at the age of 27, when he was elected to two terms as Ada County prosecuting attorney. Following his tenure as president of the Idaho Prosecuting Attorneys Association, he served 11 elected terms in the Idaho State Senate. His time as senator was highlighted by his quick election to the leadership positions of majority leader and Senate president pro tempore, serving in the top two positions of Senate leadership for 19 of his 22 years. 

Senator Risch earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Forestry from the University of Idaho, and a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Idaho, College of Law. He served on Law Review and the College of Law Advisory Committee at the University of Idaho and has taught criminal law at Boise State University. He was a small business owner, a rancher/farmer, and a senior partner in the Risch Goss Insinger Gustavel Law firm at the time of his election to the U.S. Senate. 

Senator Risch and his wife Vicki have been married for more than 50 years. Their commitment to Idaho and their work together earned them the distinction of being selected as Idaho's Healthy Marriage Ambassadors in 2007. They have three married sons and nine grandchildren.

SN021,"Schmitt, Eric",Missouri,Republican,III,SR-387,Schmitt,Schmitt.senate.gov/about/,"Eric Schmitt grew up in Bridgeton, Missouri which sits in North St. Louis County in the shadow of the airport. Eric is a sixth-generation Missourian, coming from a long line of farmers, teachers, and small business owners who have lived and worked in the Missouri cities of Tipton, Pilot Grove, Louisiana, and St. Louis.

EricÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs grandfather served in the 7th Army during World War II and saw major combat as an infantryman. He returned from WWII with nothing more than an 8th grade education and some money he won playing craps on the Queen Elizabeth coming back from the war. After WWII, EricÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs grandfather opened a butcher shop and started a family. EricÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs father worked his way through night school to provide for his family. He watched his father work 7 days a week on the midnight shift at the Anheuser-Busch brewery to provide a better life for his family, an experience that taught him the value of a strong work ethic.

Eric attended De Smet Jesuit High School and went on to graduate cum laude from Truman State University where he founded a Habitat for Humanity chapter. After graduation, he attended law school at Saint Louis University where he received his J.D. and served as an editor of the Law Review. EricÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs love for the Constitution ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the bedrock of AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs legal system ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ inspired him to teach a course on 21st Century American Civics at SLU after graduation.

Eric and his wife Jaime have three children: Stephen, Sophia, and Olivia. Their son, Stephen, was born with a rare genetic condition called Tuberous Scleroris, causing tumors on his organs. He also has epilepsy, is on the autism spectrum, and is non-verbal. Stephen was EricÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs inspiration to run for public office so he could be a voice for individuals like Stephen and their families.

SERVING
MISSOURI.
As Attorney General, Eric launched multiple major initiatives to make Missouri safer. In his first month in office, Eric launched his Safer Streets Initiative, featuring unprecedented cooperation between the U.S AttorneyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Office and the Attorney GeneralÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Office en route to taking the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs most violent offenders off the streets. Eric also launched his OfficeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first Cold Case Unit to deliver justice to victims who have waited far too long for closure. To address the backlog of untested sexual assault kits, Eric launched the SAFE Kit initiative to bring justice for the brave individuals who came forward to tell their stories. Eric was also committed to tackling the opioid crisis, securing necessary resources for treatment to those affected across the state.

Eric also led fights to secure the border and make America energy independent. Working with a broad coalition of attorneys general, Eric ensured successful border policies were continued and fought for domestic energy exploration to lower the price at the gas pump.

Previously, Missourians elected Eric as their 46th State Treasurer where he fought to safeguard precious taxpayer dollars by deploying a statewide tool allowing citizens to see how their money was spent. 

Before serving as Treasurer, he was elected twice to represent MissouriÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 15th Senate District, where he authored two of the largest tax cuts in state history, championed landmark legislation to end the unjust practice of taxation by citation, and advocated for those with special needs.


IN THE
SENATE.
Since becoming a United States Senator, his priorities have remained similar to those at the local level: Protecting free speech, fighting the administrative state, and ensuring that Missourians are taken care of.

Senator SchmittÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first piece of legislation took aim directly at the administrative state, and he has since introduced multiple pieces of legislation that aim to: protect freedom of speech online, root out DEI in corporate boardrooms and in government offices, end COVID tyranny, improve quality of life for service members and their spouses, ease the burden on commercial space launches, and more. Senator Schmitt has also fought to ensure our military is laser-focused on lethality and preparedness as we face down our chief adversary China.

Senator Schmitt serves on the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. He is the ranking member for the Space and Science Subcommittee. Eric is also on the Communications, Media, and Broadband Subcommittee and the Surface Transportation, Maritime, Freight, and Ports Subcommittee.

He visits all 62 counties every year and has delivered countless large and small victories across the state, including delivering $20 billion to rebuild after the 9-11 terror attacks and passing a $63 billion relief package to help New York recover from Superstorm Sandy. From massive snowstorms in Western New York to numerous floods across Upstate, Chuck has delivered aid and support to New Yorkers in their time of need. From authoring a permanent tax credit to offset the rising costs of college tuition, to protecting Social Security and Medicare and encouraging job-creating infrastructure projects, Senator Schumer has made it a hallmark of his career to protect the middle class and those working to reach it ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ including finding common sense solutions to national issues. 

Chuck was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, where his dad, Abraham, owned a small exterminating business and his mom, Selma, was a housewife. He attended public school and graduated from James Madison High School before heading to Harvard University, and then Harvard Law School. Chuck has two daughters, Jessica and Alison, and he still resides in Brooklyn with his wife, Iris Weinshall.

After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1974, Chuck was elected to the New York State Assembly. He quickly made a mark with his trademark vigor and relentless advocacy. In 1980, at 29, Chuck was elected as a congressman from the 9th Congressional District. Chuck represented the 9th CD in Brooklyn and Queens for eighteen years. In an era of sky-high crime and murder rates plaguing communities throughout America, Chuck established his reputation as a consumer advocate and a pioneer in the fight against crime. He was the leading sponsor of the Violence Against Women Act to combat domestic violence and sexual assault, and the Brady Bill, instituting mandatory background checks for handgun purchases. He championed the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which organized data on crimes of bigotry and allowed federal authorities to prosecute these crimes. He also sponsored legislation requiring banks and credit card companies to provide consumers with more transparent disclosure. 

In 1998, Chuck was elected to the U.S. Senate, and he became New York's senior senator when Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan retired in 2000. Chuck kicked off his first Senate term by announcing he would visit each of New York's 62 counties every year to keep in touch with voters from every corner of the state. A tradition he continues to this day.

Throughout his time in the Senate, Chuck has made improving New YorkÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs economy his top priority.

He worked to bring affordable air service, like JetBlue, to Upstate New York. He has helped retain New York jobs at risk of leaving and attract new firms to New YorkÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂcreating many thousands of family-supporting new jobs. Chuck authored legislation to eliminate barriers that delayed low-cost generic medications from entering the marketplace and led the charge to make college tuition tax deductible. He aggressively championed agricultural measures to preserve vital market support programs for New YorkÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs dairy farmers and crop growers. In 2013, Chuck worked across the aisle to pass a comprehensive immigration reform package: the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, which passed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support.

Chuck has made it a hallmark of his career to protect the middle class and those working to reach it.

New YorkÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Senator Chuck Schumer was first elected to the Senate in 1998. After New Yorkers re-elected him in 2004, Chuck secured two powerful posts: a seat on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs tax, trade, social security and healthcare legislation, and the Chairmanship of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC). Chuck successfully led the DSCC for two consecutive cycles and greatly expanded the number of seats in his conference. Following the elections of 2006, then-Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) appointed Chuck to serve as Vice Chair of the Democratic Conference, the number three position on the Democratic Leadership team. In 2016, Chuck was again re-elected by the people of New York. At the same time, his colleagues elected him to serve as Leader of the Democratic Caucus, the first time a New York Senator has held the position. In 2021, Chuck became the first New Yorker to serve as Senate Majority Leader. As Majority Leader, Chuck has led the Senate through one the most productive periods in its history, ushering landmark legislation through the Senate including the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS And Science Act, the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the American Rescue Plan, and much more.

EARLY LIFE
Chuck Grassley was born September 17, 1933, on a farm in Butler County, Iowa, where he continues to farm today. Coming of age on the heels of the Great Depression instilled principles of conservationism and fiscal conservatism. He was also brought up in a household that valued hard work and civic engagement. His mother, Ruth, was one of the first four women in Iowa to cast a vote following the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment.

Grassley studied political science at the University of Northern Iowa, and frequently returns to his alma mater to root for the Panthers at athletic events.

for civic engagement is hardwired for public service. He began growing corn and soybeans at an early age and is one of only two active farmers in the Senate today. While farming, he also worked on various factory floors over a span of two decades, and was a member of the International Association of Machinists. Grassley also spent several years as an adjunct professor teaching government courses. His diverse work experience and rural background guide his policymaking in Washington.

PUBLIC SERVICE
GRASSLEY IS THE LONGEST SERVING U.S. SENATOR IN IOWA HISTORY.

His seniority, experience and respect earned over years of service ensures Iowans have an influential seat at the policymaking table.

Grassley was first elected to the Iowa state legislature in 1958 and served there until Iowans sent him to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1974. In 1980, Grassley was elected to the U.S. Senate, where heÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs developed a reputation for bipartisanship and pragmatism. This approach to legislating consistently earns Grassley high marks as one of the SenateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs most effective and collaborative lawmakers. In each post, serving Iowans has always been GrassleyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs guiding light and primary objective.

Senator Edward J. Markey, a consumer champion and national leader on energy, environmental protection and telecommunications policy, has a prolific legislative record on major issues across the policy spectrum and a deep commitment to improving the lives of the people of Massachusetts and our country.
About EdDownload Official Portrait
Whether the issue is climate change, clean energy, safeguarding privacy, nuclear non-proliferation, investor protection or preserving an open Internet that spurs competition and consumer choice, Senator Markey stands up for the priorities and values of Massachusetts.

While serving for 37 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, Senator Markey fought for his constituents throughout his Congressional District. When he was Dean of the Massachusetts delegation in the House, he worked to harness the energy and influence of his colleagues on behalf of the entire Commonwealth. Elected to the Senate in a special election in June 2013, Senator Markey is bringing his experience, energy and expertise to fight for all the people of Massachusetts.

Senator Markey has amassed an unparalleled record of energy and environmental legislative achievements. He has consistently fought to create new jobs in American clean energy and served as a leading consumer champion against rising gas prices and foreign oil. He is the principal House author of the 2007 fuel economy law, which will increase fuel economy standards to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, the first increase in a generation. He also is the author of the appliance efficiency act of 1987, which stopped the construction of hundreds of coal-fired plants. Senator Markey authored the law that established the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve, ensuring that New England families wonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt be left out in the cold when oil prices spike. And he is the author of the revolutionary law that requires electricity regulators to open up the wholesale electric power market for the first time.

markey-students
In 2009, Congressman Markey was the co-author of the landmark Waxman-Markey bill, the only comprehensive climate legislation ever to pass a chamber of Congress. It gave hope to the world that the United States was serious about addressing climate change and helped America effectively negotiate with the international community.

Senator Markey was a leading voice in the investigation into the BP oil spill. He insisted that the company reveal the true size of the spill's flow rate, raised concerns about the use of toxic chemical dispersants into the environment and forced BP to make live video footage of the oil spill available to the public on the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂSpillcamÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ website he created. BP ultimately pled guilty to 14 counts, including one count of Obstruction of Congress for making false and misleading statements and withholding information and documents from then-Rep. Markey about the true size of the spill.

In the House of Representatives, Congressman Markey served as the Ranking Member of the Natural Resources Committee. From 2007 to 2010, he served as Chairman of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, a signature committee established by then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He also served on the Energy and Commerce Committee, where he was Chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment.

A member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, Senator Markey is a national leader on telecommunications policy, technology and privacy. In the House, he served for 20 years as Chair or Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, where he fostered the growth of new information technologies and was the principal author of many of the laws now governing our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs telephone, broadcasting, cable television, wireless, and broadband communications systems. He is the House author of the 1992 Cable Act, which increased choices for millions of consumers and enabled satellite-delivered programming to be more widely offered.
Markey oath
He also authored the law in 1993 that moved over 200 MHz of spectrum from government to commercial use, creating the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th wireless phone companies. New companies entered the market with digital technology, forcing the incumbents to innovate and invest and pushing mobile phone prices down.
Congressman Markey authored the landmark Telecommunications Act of 1996, ushering competition into the telecommunications marketplace and unleashing private sector investment.

Competition remains Senator MarkeyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs economic mantraÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂin his words, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂruthless Darwinian competition that would bring a smile to Adam Smith.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ He has been instrumental in breaking up anti-consumer, anti-innovative monopolies in electricity, long-distance and local telephone service, cable television, and international satellite services. He was one of the only members of the House Commerce Committee to fight AT&TÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs monopoly in the early 1980ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs and is a principal author of the requirement that the Bell Operating companies accept local telephone service in the 1990ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs. His pro-competition policies have directly benefited job creation in Massachusetts and throughout the country.

While in the House, Congressman Markey introduced the Internet Freedom Preservation Act, the first net neutrality bill introduced in Congress, to ensure that as the Internet continues to evolve, it remains a level playing field guided by the principles of openness, competition and innovation. He also has been a key leader on providing privacy protections for personal information such as medical records, financial records, and on-line purchases. He has championed strengthening privacy protections for children and is the House author of the ChildrenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Online Privacy and Protection Act (COPPA), the primary law that safeguards childrenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs privacy online.
Markey with Obama
From 2003 to 2009 in the House of Representatives, Senator Markey also served as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee. In that capacity, he focused on closing gaps in our homeland defenses, particularly in the areas of nuclear, aviation, maritime, liquefied natural gas and chemical security. In the wake of the 9-11 attacks, he authored the first-ever mandate in the law that 100% of cargo on passenger planes is screened, and 100% of all maritime cargo is scanned before entering AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ports.
Senator Markey also was the leader of the national Nuclear Freeze movement and has been a Congressional champion on nuclear nonproliferation. His amendment to ban all underground nuclear testing passed in 1986, and in the 1990s, he fought to tighten controls on global trafficking in nuclear technology. Since then, Senator Markey has continued his work on nuclear nonproliferation, successfully enacting new restrictions on exports of nuclear and dual-use technologies to Iran, North Korea, and other countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism and pressing for stronger nuclear nonproliferation conditions on all future nuclear trade cooperation agreements As founder of the Nonproliferation Caucus, Senator Markey continues to spearhead efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to safeguard the future for generations to come.

He is the author of some of the most important Wall Street reform laws since the Great Depression, including statutes that strengthened penalties against insider trading, improved federal oversight over the stock and futures markets, and reformed regulation of the government securities market.

Senator Markey was born in Malden, Massachusetts, on July 11, 1946. He attended Boston College (B.A., 1968) and Boston College Law School (J.D., 1972). He served in the U.S. Army Reserve and was elected to the Massachusetts State House where he served two terms representing Malden and Melrose.

In January 2013, Angus King was sworn in as MaineÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first Independent United States Senator, filling the same seat once held by storied Maine leaders Edmund Muskie, George Mitchell, and Olympia Snowe.

A strong believer in the need for greater bipartisan dialogue and relationship building, Senator King is proud to join the long line of thoughtful, independent leaders from the State of Maine, and he works hard every day to bring Republicans and Democrats together to find common-sense solutions for Maine and America. He is a proven consensus-builder who ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂcalls ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂem like he sees ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂemÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ, putting civility and respect ahead of political ideology.

Senator King is a member of the Armed Services Committee, the Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. He has made it a priority not to miss Committee hearings, earning him praise from his colleagues and the reputation as a workhorse in the Senate. The late Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), who served as Armed Services Chairman, once called Senator King ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂone of the most serious and hard-working membersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ of the Committee.

In his time in the Senate, Senator King has worked to strengthen AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs national security, conducted critical oversight of the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Intelligence Community, supported common-sense budget priorities that promote prosperity and reduce the national debt, fought the national opioid and heroin epidemic, coordinated efforts to revitalize MaineÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs forest economy, advocated for policies that contribute to cleaner, cheaper energy and mitigate climate change, railed against the corrosive effect of unchecked money in politics, fought to improve access to health care, worked to strengthen the governmentÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs support of veterans, and promoted increased access to critical community resources like rural broadband.

Senator King has achieved significant legislative victories since taking office. He led efforts to draft and pass the Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013, which averted drastic increases in student loan interest rates, saved students across the country more than $50 billion in interest payments, and set the program on a path to long-term financial stability. In 2018, Senator King successfully included a number of provisions in the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, legislation focused on improving the federal governmentÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs response to the opioid epidemic. The legislation, which passed overwhelmingly, included language backed by Senator King to make medication-assisted treatment more readily available and adjust federal restrictions to allow residential treatment facilities to increase treatment capacity. In the face of the coronavirus pandemic, he introduced the Paycheck Protection Flexibility Act to improve the Paycheck Protection Program and provide additional flexibility for business owners whoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂve received PPP loans.

A leading voice on the importance of improving AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs cybersecurity, Senator King was selected by Congressional leadership to co-chair the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, a bipartisan effort established by Congress to review the threats facing America in cyberspace and develop a forward looking plan on how to defend ourselves against cyber threats. The commission, which consisted of bipartisan members of Congress, top Executive Branch officials, and nonpartisan industry leaders, laid out more than 75 recommendations to improve the cybersecurity of U.S. critical infrastructure and prepare the nation for future challenges in an increasingly digital world.

In fact, it is in small working groups like this that Senator King has focused much of his work. Senator King is committed to working across the aisle in small, bipartisan working groups that bridge partisan divides to address the challenges that face the nation. He co-founded the Former Governors Caucus, which brings together the SenateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs former Governors to chart pragmatic approaches to solutions, as well as the Senate Arctic Caucus, which hones in on Maine and AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs growing interest in the Arctic. Senator King also tries to informally bridge the partisan divide in Washington by frequently bringing his colleagues on both sides of the aisle to his home for barbeque dinners, where political talk is banned and the focus is getting to know one another. The bonds that are formed through these relationships often lay the foundation for successful legislation.

Prior to taking office, Senator King served as the 72nd Governor of Maine. During his two terms in the Blaine House, he focused on economic development and job creation.  Then-Governor King also achieved significant reforms in education, mental health services, land conservation, environmental protection, and the delivery of state services. He was re-elected in 1998 by one of the largest margins in MaineÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs history.

Senator King is married to Mary Herman and has four sons, Angus III, Duncan, James, and Ben, one daughter, Molly, and seven grandchildren. He attended Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia Law School. In his free time, he enjoys exploring the Maine outdoors with his family in their camper.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_King,3-Jan-13,Dartmouth College,University of Virginia,,,,1,1,0,0,0,He attended Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia Law School.,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1,1,0,0,0

He is an independent leader who came to the Senate to serve ArizonaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs working families, not corporate special interests.

As the son of two police officers, Senator Kelly learned the value of public service at an early age. He attended public schools from elementary school all the way through graduate school. Senator Kelly earned his B.S. degree in marine engineering and nautical science from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and later an M.S. degree in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School.


Watching my mom break barriers to become one of the first women police officers in our town taught me a lot about facing challenges head on to achieve your goals. I continue to be inspired by her.


As a Navy pilot, he made multiple deployments on the aircraft carrier USS Midway and flew 39 combat missions in Operation Desert Storm. Senator Kelly is the recipient of the Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, two Distinguished Flying Crosses, and multiple Air Medals.


He has logged more than 5,000 flight hours in more than 50 different aircraft and has over 375 carrier landings. Senator Kelly retired from the Navy with the rank of Captain.

When I was 16, it was hard to believe that I would reach my dreams to become a Navy pilot and NASA astronaut. ThatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs why I am working to ensure every Arizonan gets a chance to achieve their own dreams.

In 1996, he was selected as an astronaut in the same NASA class as his identical twin brother Scott. Senator KellyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first of four trips into space was as pilot of STS-108 in December 2001, during which he helped deliver equipment, supplies, and additional crew members to the International Space Station. 

All in all, Senator Kelly has spent more than 50 days in space ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ traveling over 20 million miles. He retired from NASA in 2011 after commanding Space Shuttle Endeavour on its final flight.


When youÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂre looking down from space at Earth, it really puts it into perspective that weÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂre all in this together.

Mark Kelly
Now, Senator Kelly has embarked on his next mission ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ serving as a U.S. Senator for Arizona, in the seat once held by Senator John McCain. After being sworn in on December 2, 2020, Senator Kelly went right to work helping Arizona get through the COVID-19 pandemic. He helped pass the American Rescue Plan, which put shots in arms and direct relief in the pockets of Arizonans. The Community Navigator Program, which Senator Kelly championed in the American Rescue Plan, is helping ArizonaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs small businesses access the resources they need to keep their doors open and save local jobs.

Mark Kelly
Senator Kelly has broken through Washington gridlock to deliver real results for Arizonans. In his first year, he played a key role in shaping and passing the historic bipartisan infrastructure law, which is improving ArizonaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs roads, bridges, water systems, ports of entry, high-speed internet access, wildfire response, and much more.

HeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs taking on Washington corruption by introducing bold proposals to ban stock trading by members of Congress and put an end to corporate PACs.

Senator Kelly has also introduced a resolution that would require all members of Congress to publicly post their official schedule online. He is leading the effort to bring more transparency and accountability to Washington.

Senator Kelly also worked on a bipartisan basis to secure the Senate passage of a $52 billion deal thatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂll increase domestic microchip manufacturing to create high-paying Arizona jobs, strengthen supply chains to lower costs, and bolster national security. Additionally, he helped negotiate a landmark deal to drive down prescription drug prices and lower out-of-pocket costs for seniors.


Whether it was in the Navy or at NASA, we were all about teamwork and accomplishing the mission. ThatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs how it should be in Washington, too.

Senator KellyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs focus remains on working with both Republicans and Democrats to create good-paying jobs, cut taxes for middle-class families, and lower costs for Arizonans.

Mark Kelly speaks about the Brandon Act
Senator Kelly serves on the Armed Services, Environment and Public Works, Intelligence, Aging, and Joint Economic Committees. He is Chair of the Senate Armed Services Airland Subcommittee, where he plays a leading role in getting our airmen and soldiers the tools they need to do their jobs, while also expanding ArizonaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs role in our national defense.

Senator HoevenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs priorities in the Senate include working to implement national policies similar to the ones driving North DakotaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs economic success. He is committed to creating a business climate that fosters job growth and robust economic activity. Equally important to the senator are measures to reduce the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs budget deficits and debt.  He believes a commonsense approach that fosters free enterprise and empowers people to innovate and invest will strengthen our national economy and create jobs for our country in a sustainable, ongoing way.

As a senator, Hoeven has been leading efforts to develop a comprehensive national energy plan similar to North DakotaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs EmPower North Dakota, a comprehensive plan that encourages an all-of-the-above approach to development and includes both traditional and renewable resources. Hoeven believes such an approach will lead to jobs, economic growth and true energy security for America.  The senatorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs work includes serving as the leading advocate for approving the Keystone XL pipeline and advancing measures that will eliminate outdated and unnecessary regulations that are prolonging the approval process and discouraging investment and innovation. 

In addition, as a member of both the Agriculture Committee and the conference committee that negotiated the 2014 final farm bill, Hoeven played a crucial role in crafting and passing a long term farm bill that provides the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs producers with the certainty they need to plan for the future, as well as new tools to manage risk with enhanced crop insurance. The senator continues to work to make sure the farm bill is implemented in a timely and effective way.

Prior to his election to the Senate, Senator Hoeven served as governor of North Dakota for a decade.  Under his leadership, the state expanded and diversified its economy and gained thousands of new jobs.  North DakotaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs wages and personal income today continue to grow faster than the national average, and in recent years the state has led the nation in export growth.  North Dakota regularly balances its budget, has set aside more strong reserves for the future, cut taxes, and invested in priorities like education, law enforcement and infrastructure.

As governor, Hoeven also placed a strong focus on developing North DakotaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs vast energy resources.  Beginning in 2002, he initiated EmPower ND, a comprehensive energy plan for the state that includes all energy resources as well as a conservation component.  Today, North Dakota stands as an energy powerhouse and one of the largest energy producing and exporting states in the nation. Currently, North Dakota produces more than one million barrels of oil a day and ranks as the second largest oil-producing state in the country.

Senator Hoeven was born in Bismarck.  He earned a bachelorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree from Dartmouth College in 1979 and a masterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree in business administration from Northwestern University in 1981.  He served as executive vice president of First Western Bank in Minot from 1986 to 1993, and served on many civic, community, and economic development groups.  From 1993-2000, he served as president and CEO of the Bank of North Dakota, which grew from $900 million to $1.6 billion under his leadership.

Hoeven and his wife Mical (Mikey) live in Bismarck.  They have two children, Marcela and Jack, and eight grandsons.

Senator Moran has a long history of opposing reckless spending in Washington, and as a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations has pushed for spending cuts, tougher funding standards and broad reform. Senator Moran serves as Chairman on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, which allows him to lead the funding decisions that impact men and women working at agencies like the Department of Justice, the FBI, NASA, the United States Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce, to name a few. His broad committee jurisdiction allows Senator Moran to advocate for priorities important to Kansans.

Senator Moran works to improve the quality of life for the nearly 200,000 veterans living in Kansas and across the nation as the Chairman on the Senate Committee on VeteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Affairs. His priority is to help veterans achieve success after service and to make certain they have the right care at the right time and with the provider they choose. 
 
As a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, Senator Moran advocates on behalf of Kansans regarding a number of issues vital to the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs economy, ranging from communications and product safety to empowering NCAA athletes.

As the Chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Aviation, Space and Innovation, Sen. Moran oversees investigations, legislation and hearings that contribute to the growth and safety improvement of the aviation industry.

Agriculture is a leading industry in Kansas, and Senator Moran understands the importance of providing resources for farmers and ranchers across the state and country.

He also serves as co-chair of the Senate Army Caucus, the Senate Travel and Tourism Caucus, the Congressional Task Force on Down Syndrome, the Senate NIH Caucus, the Senate Aerospace Caucus and the Senate Defense Community Caucus.

Ted is committed to ensuring every family has that same opportunity.

The beginning
ted_cruz_young
Ted grew up in Texas. His father, Rafael, fled Cuba after being tortured and imprisoned and came to Texas with just $100 sewn into his underwear. Rafael got a job washing dishes making 50 cents an hour and learned English. He worked hard and attended the University of Texas at Austin, earning a degree in mathematics. He later started a small business in the oil and gas industry. Today, Rafael is a pastor in Dallas.

TedÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs mother, Eleanor, was born in Delaware to an Irish and Italian working-class family. She became the first in her family to go to college, graduating from Rice University with a degree in mathematics. She broke boundaries at Shell as one of the few women working as a computer programmer at the dawn of the computer age.

Ted earned his undergraduate degree from Princeton and his law degree from Harvard Law School. After law school, Ted clerked for Chief Justice Rehnquist and then worked in private practice. In 1999, Ted joined George W. BushÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs campaign for president as a domestic policy advisor. The best thing about TedÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs experience on the Bush-Cheney campaign, by far, was meeting Heidi Nelson, who also worked on the policy team. Heidi and Ted married after the campaign.

Representing Texas

Following his service as Solicitor General, Ted returned to private practice, where he continued to litigate high stakes cases and argued his ninth case before the Supreme Court.

Ted and Heidi also started their family, welcoming Caroline and Catherine.

In 2013, Ted was sworn into the United States Senate, where he has been a passionate fighter for limited government, economic growth, and national security. He has authored dozens of legislative measures that have been signed into law, including expanding 529 college savings accounts to allow parents to save for K-12 public, private, and religious education, repealing ObamacareÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs individual mandate, imposing sanctions on terrorists who use civilians as human shields, designating North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, targeting PutinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Nord Stream 2 pipeline through multiple bills that halted construction and kept it stalled, reauthorizing and reforming NASA, holding dictatorships in South America accountable, and ensuring the availability of additional records to help solve civil rights cold cases.

Throughout her public service, Senator Klobuchar has always embraced the values she learned growing up in Minnesota. Her grandfather worked 1500 feet underground in the iron ore mines of Northern Minnesota. Her father, Jim, was a newspaperman, and her mother, Rose, was an elementary school teacher who continued teaching until she was 70. Senator Klobuchar has built a reputation of putting partisanship aside to help strengthen the economy and support families, workers, and businesses. In 2019, an analysis by Vanderbilt University ranked her as the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂmost effectiveÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Democratic senator in the 115th Congress.

Senator Klobuchar is guided by the belief that her first duty is to represent the people of Minnesota. She acted quickly to obtain full funding to rebuild the I-35W bridge just thirteen months after it tragically collapsed into the Mississippi River. She worked across party lines to expand education and job opportunities for returning service members, fought to ensure that Minnesota National Guard members received the full benefits they earned, and helped turn Minnesota's ground-breaking ""Beyond the Yellow Ribbon"" program into a national model. As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Klobuchar worked to pass several bipartisan Farm Bills to strengthen MinnesotaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs rural economy and give farmers the certainty and support they need.

Since arriving in the Senate, Senator Klobuchar has worked with Democrats and Republicans to get things done. She led the effort to pass landmark pieces of legislation to end human trafficking and combat the fentanyl and overdose crises. She fought to pass the most significant consumer product safety legislation in a generation, keeping foreign toxic products off our shores and out of our stores, and pushed cell phone companies to enact more consumer-friendly policies. Additionally, her efforts to protect consumers have resulted in the largest furniture and airbag recalls in American history.

As a member of the Joint Economic Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator Klobuchar has been a leader in working to implement a competitive agenda to ensure businesses have the tools they need to grow and create good jobs in their communities. She has established herself as a leader on addressing supply chain issues, successfully leading the bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act to address sky-high shipping prices, which was ultimately signed into law. She has also authored legislation to lift the trade embargo with Cuba as well as legislation to help small businesses tap into new markets abroad and foster the creation and growth of new businesses across the country. She has successfully advocated to take action to combat illegal steel dumping. As co-chair of the Senate Broadband Caucus, Senator Klobuchar has been a leading advocate working to connect every American to high speed internet once and for all. Her provisions to expand high-speed broadband across the country were included in the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in 2021. She has also passed significant legislation aimed at increasing funds for STEM education and led national initiatives to boost American tourism, including a long-term reauthorization of Brand USA, which helps attract international travelers to destinations throughout the United States. Finally, she has established herself as a key voice on workforce training and leads bills to boost apprenticeships, skills training, and community and technical college so that America can continue to compete on the world stage.

Senator Klobuchar also serves as the Chairwoman on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights, where she has worked to reinvigorate AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs antitrust laws and restore competition to American markets. In this capacity, she introduced legislation to give federal enforcers the resources they need to do their jobs, strengthen prohibitions on anticompetitive conduct and mergers, and make additional reforms to improve enforcement. In 2022, her bipartisan bill to create rules of the roads for digital markets became the first piece of antitrust tech legislation to pass the Senate Judiciary Committee since the advent of the Internet. The Washington Post credited her approach, noting, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂThe moderate but meaningful proposals provide a launchpad for cross-aisle cooperation, a goal of much of the senatorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs legislative handiwork.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ She has also introduced bipartisan legislation to lower prescription drug prices by cracking down on ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂpay-for-delayÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ agreements, the practice of brand-name drug manufacturers using pay-off agreements to keep more affordable generic equivalents off the market. Long focused on bringing down costs for families, provisions from Senator KlobucharÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs legislation to finally unleash Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices with the big pharmaceutical companies were signed into law in 2022.

Senator Klobuchar is also the Chairwoman of the Senate Rules Committee, where she has worked to ensure fairness, transparency, and efficiency in government. During a Joint Session of Congress to receive each stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election, she led the defense of challenges to ArizonaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs and PennsylvaniaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs electoral votes, working with a bipartisan group of her colleagues to stand up for our democracy. In response to the January 6th insurrection, she led a bipartisan investigation into the security, planning, and response failures related to the violent and unprecedented attack. The report made recommendations, including passing a law to change Capitol Police Board procedures and improving intelligence sharing. Senator Klobuchar has worked across the aisle to implement these recommendations.

Senator Klobuchar spearheaded the Freedom to Vote Act in the U.S. Senate and continues to lead on multiple voting issues, including spearheading the work to pass the bipartisan Electoral Count Reform Act. Additionally, she helped pass the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate and has authored legislation to automatically register eligible voters when they turn 18. She has also led efforts to improve election security and prevent foreign interference in our democracy and successfully secured $1.2 billion to strengthen statesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ election infrastructure and help protect them from future attacks by foreign adversaries. In addition, in her role on the Judiciary Committee she has been active in advocating for legislation focused on increased funding for police, civil rights, drug courts, criminal justice, and immigration reform.

As a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, Senator Klobuchar has worked on behalf of MinnesotaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs farmers, agriculture workers, and rural communities by fighting to expand access to broadband, support food assistance programs, and provide stability to livestock producers. She has also passed legislation to encourage the use of renewable fuels and invest in data related to farming and agriculture to inform best practices. Additionally, Senator Klobuchar is devoted to passing on MinnesotaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs tradition of outdoor recreation, fishing, and hunting to the next generation and has secured significant funding for research, restoration, and conservation activities, including the 2022 Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Reauthorization Act. Senator Klobuchar is also strongly supportive of efforts to combat climate change.

Before serving in the Senate, Senator Klobuchar headed the largest prosecutorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs office in Minnesota for eight years, making the prosecution of violent criminals her top priority while increasing the officeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs focus on white collar crime. In the Senate, she has championed reauthorizations of the local COPS Hiring Program and has prioritized both the funding of local police officers across the country as well as federal law enforcement such as the U.S. Capitol Police, U.S. Attorneys Offices, the FBI, and the U.S. Marshals Service. She led the effort for successful passage of MinnesotaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first felony DWI law and received the leadership award from Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Her safe schools initiative, community prosecution efforts, and criminal justice reforms earned national awards from both the Bush and Clinton Justice Departments. She worked with the Innocence Project to advocate for videotaped interrogations across the country as well as innovative eyewitness processes to protect against false identifications. As a private citizen and before being elected to public office, Senator Klobuchar was the leading advocate for successful passage of one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing 48-hour hospital stays for new moms and their babies.

Senator KlobucharÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs work has gained national recognition. Vogue magazine described her as ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂpersonable, popular, and pragmatic,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ The New York Times described her as a ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂformer prosecutor with made-for-state-fair charms,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and Working Mother named her as ""Best in CongressÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ for her efforts on behalf of working families. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂWant to reform antitrust? Amy Klobuchar knows where to start,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ The Washington Post headlined its opinion piece on her sweeping antitrust legislation, the Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act. She has received numerous awards from the National Farm Bureau and National Farmers Union for championing farmers and rural communities. She has been recognized for her work on behalf of children and consumers, and Refugee International gave her the Congressional Leadership Award for her work to support refugee communities. She received an award from the Service Women's Action Network (SWAN) for her work to fight sexual assault in the military, and the Disabled American Veterans honored her work to improve the lives of AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs veterans. She also received the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂOutstanding Member of the Senate AwardÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ from the National Narcotic OfficersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ AssociationsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Coalition and the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂAbove and Beyond AwardÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ from the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve for her commitment to developing a supportive work environment for employees serving in the Guard and Reserves. In 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented her with the Order of Merit, First Class.

SN099,"Baldwin, Tammy",Wisconsin,Democratic,I,SH-141,Baldwin,Baldwin.senate.gov/about/,"Tammy Baldwin has committed her lifeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs work to public service because she has a deep commitment to making a difference in the lives of WisconsinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs working families. In the proud tradition of WisconsinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs state motto, Forward, she believes that we must always work together to help provide fairness, equality, and economic opportunity for all.

Born & Raised in Wisconsin
Tammy Baldwin was born in Madison, Wisconsin and raised by her grandparents in the Badger State. Her grandfather was a scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her grandmother was a gifted artist and seamstress who became chief costumer of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Theater Department.  

senator_baldwin_wisconsin
Tammy was raised by her grandparents because her mother struggled with mental illness, chronic pain, and drug abuse. Tammy had to grow up fast, as her mother struggled with addiction to prescription drugs her entire life. When the opioid epidemic spread across Wisconsin, devastating countless families and entire communities, Tammy worked in the Senate to make sure Washington finally stepped up and supported local prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts throughout the state. She also authored and worked to pass the Jason Simcakoski Memorial and Promise Act, bipartisan legislation signed into law by President Obama that strengthens oversight of the VAÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs opioid prescribing practices and provides safer and more effective care for our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Veterans.

When Tammy was nine years old, she was diagnosed with a serious childhood illness similar to spinal meningitis. She spent three months in the hospital. Her grandparents had health insurance, but they werenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt allowed to list Tammy as a dependent. Their insurance wouldnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt cover her care, and they were forced to make great sacrifices to pay for TammyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs health care.

Tammy got better, and her grandparents looked for a health insurance policy that would cover her in the future. But they discovered that because of her previous illness, they couldnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt find such a policy. Not from any insurer. Not at any price. Tammy had been branded with the words ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂpre-existing condition.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 

Now, because of the Affordable Care Act, championed by Tammy in the U.S. House of Representatives and in the U.S. Senate, children have protections that they didnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt have before and canÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt be denied health coverage because of a pre-existing condition.

As her grandmother grew older, Tammy served as her grandmotherÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs primary caregiver ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ an extremely rewarding, but also challenging responsibility. Growing up in a grandfamily and being a caregiver shaped TammyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs future in public service, and she led the bipartisan effort to support family caregivers by sponsoring and passing the RAISE Family Caregivers Act in the Senate which was signed into law in 2018.

A Commitment To Public Service
Tammy graduated from Madison West High School and went on to double-major in political science and mathematics at Smith College. In 1989, she received her law degree from the University of Wisconsin Law School. In 1986, while in law school, she served on the Madison Common Council, filling an aldermanic vacancy.

Tammy was then elected to four terms (1986-1994) on the Dane County Board of Supervisors.  In 1992, Tammy was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly as a State Representative for the 78th District, serving three terms.

In 1998, WisconsinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 2nd Congressional District shattered the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs glass ceiling and elected Tammy as the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first female member of Congress and the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first openly gay challenger sent to Congress. She served seven terms in the House of Representatives, serving on the Budget Committee, the Judiciary Committee, and the Energy and Commerce Committee. 

As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Tammy helped craft the landmark Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, leading the effort to include the provision that now allows young people to remain on their parentsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ health insurance plans up to age 26. She was also the lead sponsor of the Buffett Rule to ensure tax fairness, fought for student loan reforms to make higher education accessible and affordable, and developed a strong record of fighting against unfair trade deals that have shipped American jobs overseas.

Working for Wisconsin
Elected to the U.S. Senate on November 6, 2012, Tammy won a hard fought race and made history as Wisconsin's first woman to serve in the U.S. Senate and the first openly gay member elected to the U.S. Senate. In 2018, Senator Baldwin was re-elected by the people of Wisconsin with 55.4% of the vote.

In the Senate, Senator Baldwin is committed to working across party lines to strengthen the essential pillars of economic security for working families: investments in education and workforce readiness, building a strong Made in Wisconsin manufacturing and agriculture economy, quality health care for all Americans, and protecting the retirement security of todayÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs seniors and future generations.

Senator Baldwin has also made addressing the student debt crisis and college affordability a top priority. After holding roundtables with students and recent graduates struggling with the cost of a higher education, Senator Baldwin introduced the AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs College Promise Act to make the skills and credentials necessary for success in todayÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs economy attainable for all Americans, regardless of socio-economic status. Senator BaldwinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs legislation would create new federal-state partnerships to provide two years of tuition-free access to community or technical college programs.

As a leader in the Senate championing stronger Buy American policies, Senator Baldwin has worked across party lines to support our workers, manufacturers, and businesses. She has supported Made in America legislation, and pushed Presidents of both parties, to require the federal government to give preference to American companies and spend taxpayer dollars on American-made products and American jobs. Senator Baldwin worked to include Buy American reforms in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which makes a historic investment to create jobs and rebuild AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs infrastructure. The bipartisan legislation invests in fixing our roads and bridges and rebuilding our water infrastructure, including help for local communities to replace lead service lines and address Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) chemicals so that we provide safe and clean drinking water to people across our state. It also expands access to affordable and reliable high-speed broadband for Wisconsin families, students, small businesses, and farmers.

Senator Baldwin knows firsthand that Wisconsin farmers are the backbone of our rural communities. Representing AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Dairyland, she has been a leader in the Senate supporting dairy farmers, cheesemakers, and food processors by working to pass legislation that provides them the tools they need to innovate, develop new dairy products, reach expanded markets, and move our agriculture economy forward. She also worked to make sure her bipartisan FARMERS FIRST Act was included in the 2018 Farm Bill, which provides funding for local mental health resources and expands access to stress reduction strategies and suicide prevention programs for people who work in agriculture.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Senator Baldwin supported legislation to fund and distribute vaccinations, deliver stimulus checks and expanded tax cuts for working families, extend unemployment insurance to those out of work, and provide federal funding to small businesses, schools, and state and local governments to help them get through the public health and economic crisis.

Senator Baldwin serves on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, and the Senate Appropriations Committee.

He has focused on uniting our communities by fighting for the things we all agree on ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a stronger economy, good-paying jobs, affordable health care, a secure retirement and an opportunity for everyone to succeed.

Michigan
Roots
Gary was born in Pontiac, Michigan ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a 5th generation Michigander. His father, a World War II veteran, worked as a public school teacher and NEA union member for more than 30 years. His mother ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ who survived Nazi occupation of France and met GaryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs father while he served in Europe during the war ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ worked as a nurseÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs aide at a local nursing home. She helped organize her workplace and became an SEIU union steward.

Growing up, Gary learned the importance of hard work and fairness from his parents. He started his own small business delivering newspapers at age 11. In junior high, he bused tables at a Big Boy restaurant, and in high school and college, he worked at a local retailer and on a grounds crew. Gary is an Eagle Scout and in 2019, he was humbled to receive the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America.

Gary is also a product of Michigan schools. After graduating from Rochester High School, he attended Alma College, where he earned a B.A. in Political Science.

Gary and his wife, Colleen, live in Oakland County and have three children: Gary Jr., Madeleine and Alana. They recently became proud grandparents.

EARLY CAREER:
Service to Michigan & Country
Gary worked in the private sector for over 20 years as both a financial advisor and in a variety of management positions with two major financial service firms. He was an assistant vice president at Merrill Lynch before working at UBS/PaineWebber as a vice president.

While working a full-time job, he went on to earn an M.B.A. in Finance from the University of Detroit Mercy, an M.A. in political science from Wayne State University, an M.A. in Philosophy from Michigan State University with a focus on the ethics of development and a law degree (J.D.) from Wayne State University Law School.

Gary began his public service as a Rochester Hills City Councilman in 1991. In 1994, Gary was elected to the Michigan State Senate and served two terms. During his eight years of service, he authored and passed more bills signed into law than any other member of his party.

His combination of business and policy experience prompted then-Governor Granholm to appoint Gary to run the Michigan Lottery. As State Lottery Commissioner, he managed a multi-billion dollar business and consistently raised record amounts of money for the state School Aid Fund.

Gary volunteered for the U.S. Navy Reserve at age 34, where he earned a Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist designation and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander. After the September 11th terrorist attacks on our country, he volunteered again for drilling status and served overseas as part of his Reserve duty. He later earned a diploma from the College of Naval Command and Staff, U.S. Naval War College.

FIGHTING FOR MICHIGAN FAMILIES
Gary was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2008, where he served on the Financial Services Committee. While in his first term and one of the most junior members of the House, the Speaker appointed Gary to serve on the conference committee that wrote and finalized the sweeping Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act. He continued being a leading voice for Michigan ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ whether it was advocating for the auto rescue and Michigan manufacturing or ensuring small businesses had access to the capital needed to start, grow and succeed after the Great Recession.

In the current Congress, Gary serves as the Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which oversees the Department of Homeland Security and is the SenateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs top oversight committee. He also serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senate Armed Services Committee, and the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. In addition, Gary serves as one of six Congressional Regents on the Smithsonian InstituteÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Board of Regents, which governs and administers the organization.

In the U.S. Senate, Gary is recognized as one of the most effective and bipartisan Senators, according to the non-partisan Center for Effective Lawmaking (University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University) and the Lugar Center (Georgetown University).

During the 118th Congress (2023-2024), Gary authored and passed 15 standalone bills into law with broad bipartisan support. In the 117th Congress (2021-2022), Gary authored and was the principal sponsor of 19 bipartisan bills signed into law ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the most enacted into law by a U.S. Senator during a single Congress in over 40 years. Gary was recognized as the #1 most effective Senator in both the 116th and 117th Congresses for his ability to build coalitions and work across the aisle to pass bills into law. In the 116th Congress (2019-2020), he earned this recognition despite serving as a member of the minority party ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ an achievement that hadnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt been accomplished since the non-partisan Center for Effective Lawmaking began collecting data over 50 years ago. During those three Congresses, Gary was the principal sponsor and author of more standalone bills signed into law than any Democratic or Republican member serving in either the Senate or House. In 2023, the non-partisan Lugar Center recognized Gary as the 2nd-most bipartisan Senator ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and the most bipartisan Democrat ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ for his bipartisan work during the 117th Congress.

His bills signed into law help address issues that are important to Michiganders, including protecting the Great Lakes and securing historic funding for restoration efforts, strengthening border security, supporting our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs veterans and servicemembers, making government work more efficiently, and saving taxpayer dollars.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Peters,3-Jan-25,Alma College,University of Detroit,Wayne State University,Michigan State University,,0,0,0,0,0,"His father, a World War II veteran, worked as a public school teacher and NEA union member for more than 30 years.

SN029,"Reed, Jack",Rhode Island,Democratic,II,SH-728,Reed,Reed.senate.gov/about/,"Jack Reed is a champion for middle-class families and a strong believer that all Americans should have the opportunity to build a better life.

ROOTS
Jack was born and raised in Cranston and grew up on Pontiac Avenue.  His father, Joe, was a World War II veteran and Cranston school janitor who worked his way up to become custodial supervisor of the city's school system.  His mother, Mary, was a homemaker who was unable to go to college herself, but made sure her three children studied hard and had the opportunity to pursue a higher education.  The Reed family benefited from the GI Bill ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a program that helped countless veterans further their education and put a roof over their heads ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and JackÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs parents instilled in him the importance of serving his country and giving back to his community.

family
EDUCATION
Jack grew up attending St. Matthew's Elementary School in Cranston and graduated from La Salle Academy in Providence.  He was nominated for an appointment to the United States Military Academy by U.S. Senator John O. Pastore.  On July 3, 1967, Reed reported to West Point to begin cadet training.  After graduating from the Military Academy in 1971 near the top of his class and receiving an active duty commission in the Army, Reed earned a masterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree in public policy from HarvardÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs John F. Kennedy School of Government.  Reed also went on to earn a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1982.

DUTY, HONOR, COUNTRY
One of the highest honors and greatest privileges of JackÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs life was commanding his fellow soldiers.  He served in the 82nd Airborne Division as an Infantry Platoon Leader, a Company Commander, and a Battalion Staff Officer.  He eventually joined the faculty at West Point, teaching cadets about economics and international relations as an Associate Professor within the Department of Social Sciences.  He served as a professor at the U.S. Military Academy until August of 1979 when he resigned from active duty as a Captain.  He continued serving in the U.S. Army Reserves until June of 1991, when he left the Reserves with the rank of Major.  Over the course of his military career, he earned the Army Commendation Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, Ranger Tab, Senior Parachutist Badge, and Expert Infantry Badge.

gazing
PRIVATE PRACTICE
After graduating from law school, Jack became an attorney in private practice, first working as an associate with the law firm of Sutherland, Asbill, & Brennan before moving back to Providence and working for the firm of Edwards & Angell.  He specialized in banking and securities law.

PUBLIC SERVICE
When Jack was young, he dreamed of being an architect or a soldier.  On November 7, 1960, as he stood with his classmates and teachers along Elmwood Avenue in Cranston, Jack watched as then-Senator John F. Kennedy - who was campaigning to become President - and then-candidate Claiborne Pell - who was running to become Rhode IslandÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs U.S. Senator - drove by his school.  Jack never imagined that one day heÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂd have the opportunity to serve alongside KennedyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs brother and succeed Claiborne Pell in the United States Senate. 

Reed served three terms in the Rhode Island State Senate, where he focused on housing, childrenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs welfare, and mental health issues.  The people of Rhode Island then elected him to serve three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives.  As Rhode Island Monthly put it: ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂSince he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990, Reed has been known as the hardest of workers who tirelessly researches issues and keeps himself in the know.  His knowledge ranges far and wide, foreign and local.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

Record of Accomplishment
In 1996, the people of Rhode Island elected Jack Reed to succeed Claiborne Pell as Rhode Island's 46th United States Senator.

Senator Reed works every day to help make the federal government more efficient, effective, and responsive to the people of Rhode Island.  He has a proven record of working on a bipartisan basis to help solve problems and achieve results.  Senator Reed was part of the bipartisan working group that drafted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and successfully led efforts to create the $150 billion Coronavirus Relief Fund to help states combat COVID-19.  Senator Reed also helped include a $1.25 billion small state minimum to ensure Rhode Island could effectively respond to the pandemic.

As one of just eight Senators in U.S. history to graduate from West Point, Time magazine noted: ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂReed is a serious, intellectually honest veteran and an expert on defense issues in the Senate,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and the New York Times describes him as ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂa quiet deal-maker respected by colleagues in both parties.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

A senior member of the powerful Appropriations Committee, which controls the funding of the federal government, Senator Reed has been described by the Boston Globe as ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂa relentless advocate for his home state.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  He works tirelessly to direct federal funding to the Ocean State to create jobs, strengthen its infrastructure, and support economic and community development initiatives.

He has supported clean water projects to ensure both a healthy economy and a healthy environment.  And he authored a trio of laws to improve childrenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs health care and ensure our youngest patients get the help they need when they need it: the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research (STAR) Act to advance pediatric cancer research and child-focused cancer treatments, improve childhood cancer surveillance, and provide resources for survivors and those impacted by childhood cancer; the Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Act to establish critical care networks nationwide so that more paramedics and first responders can get trauma care patients to the right doctor at the right time; and the Better Pharmaceuticals and Devices for Children Act (BPDCA) to help ensure drugs and medical devices are specifically tested, labeled, and proven to be safe and effective for children.

Senator Reed has led efforts to strengthen Rhode IslandÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs transportation network ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ from expanding the runway at T.F. Green Airport to increasing capacity at our ports ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ in order to bring more jobs and businesses to Rhode Island and better link our state to the global economy.

Reed also serves as Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee, where he has played a pivotal role in safeguarding our nation.  In 2002, he voted against giving President George W. Bush the authority to go to war in Iraq because it was an ill-planned diversion from the war on terrorism.  But he has always worked across the aisle to support our troops, and was instrumental in convincing Defense Secretary Robert Gates to continue serving in the Obama Administration and implement the plan to withdraw forces from Iraq.

Rhode IslandÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs defense industry is critical to national security and our stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs economy, and Senator Reed has been a leader at the federal level in growing Rhode IslandÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs defense sector and bringing resources to the state.  Thanks to his efforts on the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees, coupled with Rhode IslandÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs talented defense workers, the U.S. Navy plans to begin building the next generation of submarines in the Ocean State, creating thousands of new, good-paying jobs in Rhode Island in the coming years.

As a senior member of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, Reed authored several key pieces of the historic Wall Street reform law and has been nationally recognized for his dedication to protecting U.S. consumers.  When taxpayers were forced to invest in banks to save the economy from total collapse, Jack Reed wrote the law ensuring that taxpayers would share in the rewards when the banks recovered.  As a direct result of ReedÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs provision, taxpayers have earned nearly $10 billion in additional dividends ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ money that would have otherwise been kept by the rescued banks.

He also helped create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to give American families the tools to fight unfair and abusive financial products and services, as well as a new Office of Financial Research (OFR) that will help provide early warnings to regulators about future financial problems.

Additionally, he authored laws to create a new affordable rental housing trust fund, improve consumer disclosures on mortgages, and address the needs of middle-class families who have struggled with the fallout from the housing crisis.

Senator Reed has been a leading voice on college affordability and student loan debt issues.  He helped write laws preventing interest rate increases on new loans to millions of college students, and fought efforts to increase student borrowing costs.  He recently proposed a Student Loan Borrowers Bill of Rights and has offered legislation to reform disclosure and servicing standards for both federal and private student loans.

And to help get our country back to full employment, he wrote a work-sharing law that provides an estimated $500 million for business-state partnerships to help prevent layoffs.  Nationwide, ReedÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs law has been credited with saving more than 130,000 jobs since 2012, including over 1,000 in Rhode Island.

Today, Jack Reed continues to utilize the lessons he learned growing up in Cranston, which were deepened in the Army and tested in the halls of Congress, to stand up and speak out for the hard-working families who are the heart and soul of our country.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Reed_(Rhode_Island_politician),3-Jan-97,United States Military Academy,Harvard University,,,,0,1,0,0,0,"His father, Joe, was a World War II veteran and Cranston school janitor who worked his way up to become custodial supervisor of the city's school system.

His interest in politics was sparked at a young age after making five of six free throws during a freshman high school basketball game. He was later greeted by a spectator who said, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂI noticed you missed one.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ That spectator happened to be a well-known sports enthusiast and then-South Dakota U.S. Rep. Jim Abdnor. The introduction was the start of a friendship that ignited JohnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs career in public service.

John received his undergraduate degree at Biola University and his masterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree in business administration from the University of South Dakota. Upon completion of his masterÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree in 1984, he married Kimberley Weems, a native of Doland, South Dakota.

JohnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs attraction to public service took him to Washington, D.C., to work for that sports enthusiast and then-U.S. Sen. Jim Abdnor. He then served at the Small Business Administration under an appointment from President Ronald Reagan.

In 1989, John and his family returned to South Dakota, where he served as the executive director of the South Dakota Republican Party. In 1991, then-Gov. George S. Mickelson appointed him to be state railroad director, a position he held until 1993, when he became executive director of the South Dakota Municipal League.

In 1996, with a shoestring budget and the support of family and friends, John won his first term as South DakotaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives. John was re-elected to a second term by the largest margin in South Dakota history. He returned again to Washington in 2001 to serve his third term in the House.

John then honored his 1996 campaign pledge to serve only three terms in the House. After a narrow loss in a U.S. Senate race in 2002, he won his current Senate seat in 2004, when he made history by defeating a sitting Senate party leader for the first time in 52 years.

In 2010, John was elected to serve a second term in the Senate in a rare unopposed race. He was only the third Republican and the only South Dakotan to run unopposed for the Senate since direct elections were created in 1913. John was elected to a third term in 2016. In 2022, John became the second South Dakotan in history to be elected to a fourth term in the U.S. Senate. 

For the 119th Congress, John serves on the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee; the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee; and the Finance Committee. He also serves as the Senate Majority Leader, and has previously served as the Senate Republican Whip from 2019-2024, chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee from 2009ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ2011, and chairman of the Senate Republican Conference from 2012-2018.

Her father managed a Main Street 5 and 10 cent store, where she worked growing up and first learned the value of a strong work ethic. When Patty was a young teenager, her fatherÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂa World War II veteran and Purple Heart recipientÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwas diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and in a few short years, his illness got so bad he could no longer work. PattyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs mother, who had stayed home to raise their family, had to take care of him while also working to support their family. She found some work, but it didnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt pay enough to support Patty and her six brothers and sistersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂand a husband with growing medical bills. Thankfully, they lived in a country where the government didnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt just say ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂyouÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂre on your own.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 

During this tough time, PattyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs family received some help for her fatherÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs medical care through his veterans benefits, but for several months her family had to rely on food stamps. However, thanks to a program established by the federal government, PattyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs mother was able to go back to school. And thanks to federal grants and student loans, Patty and her siblings were all able to attend college. While attending Washington State University (WSU), Patty took an internship in the psychiatric ward of the Seattle Veterans Hospital. There she personally witnessed the sacrifices of young Vietnam War veteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂmany who were her ageÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂand saw the reality of what people who went to war came home with. Even as a college student, Patty was starting to take action to make change. During her time at WSU, she successfully organized a petition to change an outdated dress code rule so women could wear jeans to the dining hall.

After attending WSU (Go Cougs!), Patty went on to teach at the Shoreline Community College preschool program and community college.

Patty Murray
As a working mom, Patty was never planning to enter politics. But when she saw problems in her community, she realized she couldnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt just wait for someone else to solve them. When local officials planned to close her kidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ preschool program due to state budget cuts, Patty took action. She packed up her two young children and went to Olympia to urge her state representatives to save the preschool program. While there, one male legislator told her she couldnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt make a difference because she was ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂjust a mom in tennis shoes.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Patty didnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt let that stop herÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂin response, she organized a grassroots coalition of 13,000 parents that fought successfully to save the preschool program. 

Patty saw the difference local government could make if it was more like the people and families it represents, which led her to serve on the Shoreline School Board, and in 1988, she was elected to the Washington State Senate. 

In 1991, Patty watched the Anita Hill hearings along with the rest of the country where the fact that there were only two women in the entire U.S. SenateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂand none on the Senate Judiciary CommitteeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwas on full display. Patty decided to run for Senate in 1992 as a voice for Washington workers and families who were not being heardÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂespecially women. Dramatically outspent, Patty ran a grassroots campaign of family, friends, supporters, and public interest groups to beat a 10-year veteran of the U.S. House of Representatives and win the Senate seat. Patty was re-elected in 1998, 2004, 2010, 2016 and 2022.

Bio
Bio
As Washington stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs senior Senator, a member of Senate Democratic leadership since 2007, and a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee since she first arrived in the Senate, Patty has a proven track record championing Washington state and breaking through partisan gridlock to solve problems, fight for progressive policies, and help workers, families, and communities.  

Patty served as the first female Chair of the Senate VeteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Affairs Committee during the 112th Congress and served as the first female Chair of the Senate Budget Committee during the 113th Congress. As Chair of the Senate VeteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Affairs Committee, Murray worked closely with Republicans to spotlight the needs of women veterans and to expand benefits and support for veteran caregivers. As Chair of the Budget Committee, she worked with Congressman Paul Ryan to pass the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 in order to avert fiscal disaster. She also served as Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions CommitteeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwhere Murray negotiated and passed significant bipartisan legislation with her Republican counterparts: rewriting No Child Left Behind, passing the 21st Century Cures Act, delivering major COVID relief, passing sweeping public health preparedness measures, and much more. 

Patty recently served as Chair of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee and made history as the first woman ever to serve as President Pro Tempore of the Senate. In the 119th Congress, she is now Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and continues to be a forceful advocate for Washington state families, pushing for progress on everything from child care and paid leave to reproductive rights and climate action. 

PattyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs approach today is the same as when she first entered politics: listen to families about the challenges they are facing, make their voices heard in the United States Capitol, then get to work to find solutions, build consensus, and deliver for the people of Washington state.

Dan Sullivan was sworn in as AlaskaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs eighth United States Senator on January 6, 2015.  Sullivan serves on four Senate committees vital to Alaska: the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee; the Armed Services Committee; the Environment and Public Works Committee; and the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Sullivan also currently serves as the Chairman of the International Republican Institute.

Prior to his election to the U.S. Senate, Sullivan served as AlaskaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Attorney General and Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. As Alaska's Attorney General, SullivanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs number one priority was protecting Alaskans, their physical safety, financial well-being, and individual rights ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ particularly AlaskaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs most vulnerable. During his tenure he spearheaded a comprehensive statewide strategy ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂChoose RespectÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ campaign ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ to combat AlaskaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs high rates of domestic violence and sexual assault.  Under SullivanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs leadership, the Department of Law also undertook an aggressive strategy of initiating and intervening in litigation aimed at halting federal government overreach into the lives of Alaskans and their economy.

As Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, Sullivan managed one of the largest portfolios of oil, gas, minerals, renewable energy, timber, land, and water in the world. Working closely with AlaskaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Governor and state legislature, Sullivan developed numerous strategies that spurred responsible resource development, energy security, and a dramatic increase in good-paying jobs across a number of critical sectors in the Alaska economy.  He also developed a comprehensive plan to streamline and reform the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs regulatory and permitting system.

Sullivan is one of a select number of Alaskan attorneys who has held judicial clerkships on both the highest federal and state courts in Alaska. He served as a judicial law clerk for Judge Andrew Kleinfeld of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Fairbanks, Alaska and for Chief Justice Warren Matthews of the Alaska Supreme Court in Anchorage, Alaska.  Sullivan also served as a judicial law clerk/intern for Judge James L. Buckley on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

EDUCATION

Kaimuki High School, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Georgetown University Law Center

I am privileged to serve the people of Hawaii in the United States Senate.
As an immigrant who grew up under difficult circumstances, I recognize that my path to the Senate was unlikely. At the same time, my experiences have shown me the incredible opportunities available in America and have fueled my desire to give back.

I owe much to the courage and determination of my mother. My early childhood was spent on my grandparents' rice farm in Fukushima, Japan. My mother sent me to live with my grandparents because of family circumstances. My father was an alcoholic and compulsive gambler and I did not get to know him much. As a result, our family had little stability or money. At times, he would even sell my mother's belongings to gamble away.

But instead of watching our family continue to suffer, my mother made the courageous decision to seek a better life for us. She plotted and planned in secret, and when I was nearly eight years old, we literally escaped to this place called Hawaii and this country called America. My mother, brother and I boarded the President Cleveland in Yokohama and crossed the Pacific in steerage.

Like many immigrants, our new life was not easy. In the beginning, my mother worked at a Japanese language newspaper for minimum wages with no benefits. She worked two jobs as a single mother to keep food on the table and a roof over our heads. We didn't have much, but we persevered.

Thanks to my mother's courage, I was able to take advantage of the educational opportunities available in Hawaii's public schools. When I began elementary school, I neither spoke nor read English. My love of reading was awakened by class trips to our school library where our librarian read to us books like Mary Poppins. I also remember being a student cashier in elementary school to pay for my lunches.

My time at the University of Hawaii at Manoa opened my eyes to a life in public service and advocacy. Through volunteer and tutor work, including weekly visits with patients at the state mental health facility, I saw how important it was for underserved populations to be heard. Participating in grassroots student protests over the Vietnam War and what our government was doing was my political awakening and a path that eventually led me to elected office as a way of being of service.

I went to law school to develop the skills I would need to more effectively advocate for others. I attended Georgetown University Law Center because it had a strong clinical program and I wanted to focus on public interest law. After graduation, I worked in the antitrust division of the Hawaii attorney general's office.

Although prior to law school I had helped many others run for office, I had not thought about becoming a candidate myself. However, with the encouragement of others, I successfully ran for a seat in the Hawaii House of Representatives in 1980. As chair of the House Consumer Protection and Commerce Committee, I focused on greater protections for Hawaii's workers and consumers.

After serving more than a decade in the House, I was elected lieutenant governor in 1994. I led an effort to revamp Hawaii's workers' compensation insurance laws, saving businesses millions. I also helped lead state efforts to improve early childhood education and promote Hawaii's tourism industry through visa reform, issues I continue to champion in the U.S. Senate.

As my party's first female nominee for governor, although I lost the race in 2002, I wanted to help other women running for office and founded the Patsy T. Mink PAC in 2004 to that end. Congresswoman Patsy Mink, for whom Title IX was renamed after her death, was my friend and her legacy lives on in schools and universities across the country.

In 2006, I was elected to Congress by voters in Hawaii's second congressional district, representing the seat once held by Patsy. During my time in the House, our nation and state faced incredible challenges and opportunities. I supported struggling families by preserving Hawaii's pre-paid health care law, teamed up with colleagues across the aisle to protect Native Hawaiian education programs, became a nationally recognized advocate for quality early childhood education, promoted food and energy sustainability and sponsored legislation to support Hawaii's critical tourism industry and create jobs.

With the retirement of Senator Daniel Akaka, the people of Hawaii elected me to the U.S. Senate, where I serve as the first Asian American woman and first woman senator from Hawaii. As Hawaii's United States Senator, I have put the values, people, and communities of Hawaii at the forefront of my work every day. Whether it is welcoming Hawaii visitors to my Washington D.C. office for weekly Talk Story events, bringing aloha to our nation's Capital as part of the annual Hawaii on the Hill showcase of local businesses, or sitting down with and helping Hawaii constituents and businesses cut through federal red tape at home, my work as a Senator is driven by my connection to Hawaii and energized by the people and place that we call home.

Working collaboratively both with Hawaii stakeholders and my colleagues in Washington, I'm proud of what we have been able to accomplish. As a member of the Senate Armed Services and Veterans Affairs Committees I have the opportunity to work on important legislation that highlights and supports Hawaii's critical role in our nation's security in the Asia-Pacific region and honors our commitments to servicemembers, veterans, and their families. Legislation I've authored to honor our Filipino World War II Veterans, promote clean energy use by the military, expand opportunities for Hawaii small businesses, and invest in the education, training, and treatment of servicemembers from their time in uniform to their transition home are some of my proudest accomplishments in these areas.

Efforts to take away health care, slash funding for public schools, or undermine the civil rights that so many rely on are things that I strongly oppose and have fought against. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee I have worked to promote these values in fighting against unqualified nominations, promote fairer treatment of immigrants and minority groups, and protect the civil rights of everyone.

It is a privilege to do my very best for Hawaii in the U.S. Senate. With my background and experiences, I never forget where I came from or who I fight for and why.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazie_Hirono,3-Jan-13,University of Hawaii,Georgetown University,,,,0,1,0,0,0,"Kaimuki High School, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Georgetown University Law Center

Elected nine times to lead the Republican conference from 2006-2024, he is also the longest-serving Senate party leader in American history. From 2015 to 2021, McConnell was just the second Kentuckian to serve as Senate Majority Leader, following Senator Alben Barkley (1937 to 1949). He previously served in leadership as the Majority Whip and as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

McConnellÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs consequential Senate leadership has earned widespread praise. Seasoned observers have called him ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe most important Republican since Ronald ReaganÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe most important leader of the United States Senate in American historyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ. On three occasions, TIME Magazine named McConnell one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World.

McConnell led a transformation of the federal judiciary in a victory for the rule of law and the Constitution. His decision to follow precedent and keep a Supreme Court vacancy open during the 2016 presidential election gave Republicans the opportunity to confirm three justices to the Court. In four years, he prioritized the confirmation of 30% of circuit court judges nationwide and a total of 234 lifetime appointments to the federal bench.

Throughout his career, McConnell has championed an internationalist foreign policy grounded in a strong national defense, robust trade, and strategic alliances and partnerships. He recognizes global leadership as the cornerstone of U.S. national security and leads efforts to restore AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs hard power in the tradition of peace through strength. His work on this front continues in leadership of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense.

McConnell made history in 1984 as the only Republican challenger in the country to defeat an incumbent Democrat and as the first Republican to win a statewide Kentucky race since 1968. On November 3, 2020, he was elected to a record seventh term, winning 117 of the CommonwealthÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 120 counties.

McConnell graduated with honors from the University of Louisville College of Arts and Sciences, where he served as student body president. He also is a graduate of the University of Kentucky College of Law, where he was elected president of the Student Bar Association. He is the proud father of three daughters.

McConnell is married to Secretary Elaine Chao, the 18th U.S. Secretary of Transportation. Previously, Secretary Chao served for eight years as President George W.

Peter attended College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. Before he finished his degree, Peter left school to hitchhike to Chicago and organize against housing discrimination in 1969. After returning to school and completing his degree, he attended and received his law degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1973. After law school, Peter settled in White River Junction, Vermont, becoming one of the countyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first public defenders for low-income folks. He then founded a small law practice, winning high profile cases to restore retirement benefits for workers, protect property rights for the elderly, and more.

The PeopleÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Advocate: Vermont Politics
He was first elected to the Vermont State Senate in 1980. Within five years, he was unanimously elected by his colleagues to lead the chamber, becoming the first Democrat in Vermont history to hold the position of President Pro Tempore.

In 2006, Peter ran and won VermontÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs sole seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in a race that received national attention as the only contested congressional race in the country where both candidates refused to air negative ads. Peter has worked throughout his career both to defend progressive values and also to find bipartisan compromises. He approaches his work in the Capitol the same way Vermonters do back home, focusing on getting the job done and not on getting the credit.

Championing the People: A New Chapter in the Senate
In the House, Peter worked across the aisle to lower costs for working families. HeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs led on legislation to advance green technologies, bring down the cost of prescription drugs, expand broadband and telemedicine in rural America, and more.

After Senator Patrick Leahy decided to retire after more than four decades of service in 2022, Peter ran in and won the election to become VermontÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs next Senator. In this new role, heÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs continued his work to lower costs for working families, combat the impacts of climate change, and invest in rural America.

When heÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs not working, Peter (as heÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs known by his constituents) can be found hiking and skiing around Vermont with his wife Margaret and enjoying the Green Mountain StateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs uniquely beautiful nature.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch,3-Jan-23,College of the Holy Cross,"University of California, Berkeley",,,,0,1,0,0,0,"Peter attended College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts.

Growing up in a family of entrepreneurs, Senator Budd learned the importance of faith, hard work, and common-sense decision-making at an early age.

While traveling on a Christian mission trip in the former Soviet Union in 1991, Senator Budd met a fellow student, Amy Kate, and they soon began dating and eventually were married in 1994. Senator Budd and Amy Kate have three children and still live in Davie County.

Senator Budd is a graduate of Appalachian State University, where he earned a Bachelor of Business Administration in 1994. He and Amy Kate both attended and graduated from Dallas Theological Seminary, where Senator Budd earned a Masters of Theology and Educational Leadership in 1998.

Senator Budd is a proud father of a Stars and Stripes recipient and an Eagle Scout, and he also served as an Assistant Scoutmaster. He and Amy Kate homeschooled their three children, and Senator Budd served as a board member of North Carolinians for Home Education.

In 2010, Senator Budd was approached by a friend regarding the purchase of a bankrupt gun range in Rural Hall, North Carolina for a local police department to conduct firearms training, and he did so. Later, the range was opened to the public. The storeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs motto is: ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂHelping our community responsibly enjoy firearms.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

When an opportunity presented itself after redistricting opened up North CarolinaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 13th Congressional District in 2016, Senator Budd decided to run for the seat having never sought public office before. The campaign focused on bringing a businessmanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs outlook to our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs capital. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives on November 8, 2016.

Senator Budd served three terms in the U.S. House. During his tenure, Senator Budd was a strong supporter of the America First agenda. He was a fierce advocate for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced taxes for nearly all Americans. He served on the Whip Team to gather the votes for the United StatesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂMexicoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂCanada trade Agreement in 2019, which opened up more North Carolina agricultural products to be sold in Canada and Mexico.

Senator Budd has been an avid and consistent supporter of law enforcement and the rule of law, having repeatedly voted to increase funding for local police departments across North Carolina. He was also an early supporter of building a wall on the southern border to stop the flow of drugs, human trafficking, and criminals into our country.

Senator Budd has always stood for American strength on the world stage. Whether it comes to challenging China, standing up to Russian aggression, or being tough on Islamic terrorists, Senator Budd has always supported the U.S. Armed Forces, our veterans, and their families.

Closer to home, Senator Budd has been a strong believer in the sanctity of human life, the value of family, and religious freedom. He believes that parents should be in the driverÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs seat when it comes to where their children go to school and what they are being taught.

In 2021, Senator Budd launched his campaign for the U.S. Senate to fight for all of North Carolina and to make life better for working families across the state. He was elected on November 8, 2022.

Elizabeth Warren, a fearless consumer advocate who has made her life's work the fight for middle class families, was re-elected to the United States Senate for a second term on November 6, 2018, by the people of Massachusetts.

Elizabeth is one of the nation's leading progressive voices, fighting for big structural change that would transform our economy and rebuild the middle class.

She has put forward bold, ambitious plans to:

End lobbying as we know it and make other sweeping changes to eliminate the influence of money in our federal government through the most comprehensive anti-corruption legislation since Watergate;
Impose an ultra-millionaire tax on fortunes worth over $50 million to generate $2.75 trillion in revenue over ten yearsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂenough to pay for universal child care, student debt relief, and a down payment on a Green New Deal;
Address the nation's housing crisis by building more than 3 million new homes, cutting rents nationwide by 10%, and taking the first steps towards healing the legacy of housing discrimination through historic new investments in federal housing programs;
Extend criminal accountability to corporate executives who oversee and direct illegal scams;
Give workers a greater say in the decision-making process at the nation's biggest corporations by empowering them to elect 40% of the board at the company where they work;
Require every public company to disclose climate-related risks;
Provide Puerto Rico with a path to comprehensive debt relief and rebuild the island's infrastructure;
Allocate $100 billion to solve the opioid and substance use crisis; and
Address skyrocketing prescription drug costs, including through the public manufacturing of generic drugs.
Elizabeth consistently reaches across the aisle to deliver wins for Massachusetts, making her one of the most effective members of the Senate. She helped secure $750 million in debt relief for students who were cheated by predatory, for-profit colleges, including 4,500 Massachusetts students and more than 28,000 students across the country. Elizabeth has also helped pass legislation to double federal funding for child care, make hearing aids available over the counter, reduce out-of-pocket costs for high school students enrolled in career and technical education programs, and put over $6 billion dollars in federal funding towards the fight against the opioid epidemic.

Elizabeth has used her platform to hold some of the nation's largest corporations and most powerful government agencies accountable for fraud, waste, and abuse. In the wake of the fake accounts scandal at Wells Fargo, her relentless public pressure led to the resignation of two Wells Fargo CEOs, John Stumpf and his successor, Tim Sloan. Elizabeth also launched an investigation to hold Equifax accountable for a data breach that exposed the personal financial information of over 140 million customers and wrote legislation to keep it from happening again. Through her oversight work, she has exposed fraud and abuse perpetrated by Trump Administration officials, including at the Department of Education, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Defense, and has successfully overturned rules that harm consumers and students.

Before becoming the first woman ever elected to the Senate from Massachusetts in 2012, Elizabeth served as Chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe oversight board set up in the aftermath of the financial crisis to protect taxpayers, hold Wall Street accountable, and help homeowners get back on their feet.

She is widely credited for the original thinking, political courage, and relentless persistence that led to the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she helped stand up and has successfully protected millions of consumers from financial tricks and traps often hidden in mortgages, credit cards, and other financial products.

As a law professor for more than 30 years, Elizabeth taught courses on commercial law, contracts, and bankruptcy. She has written more than a hundred articles and eleven books, including four national best-sellers, This Fight Is Our Fight, A Fighting Chance, The Two-Income Trap,and All Your Worth.

Elizabeth learned first-hand about the economic pressures facing working families, growing up in a family she says was ""on the ragged edge of the middle class."" She got married at 19, and after graduating from college, started teaching in elementary school. Her first baby, a daughter Amelia, was born when Elizabeth was 22. When Amelia was two, Elizabeth started law school. Shortly after she graduated, her son Alex was born. Elizabeth hung out a shingle and practiced law out of her living room, but she soon returned to teaching.

SN046,"Lummis, Cynthia M.",Wyoming,Republican,II,SR-127A,Lummis,Lummis.senate.gov/about/,"Cynthia Lummis was sworn into the United States Senate on January 3, 2021, becoming the first woman to serve as United States Senator from the great State of Wyoming.

Born on a cattle ranch in Laramie County, Senator Lummis has spent her entire career fighting for Wyoming families, communities, businesses and values. From the halls of the Wyoming House to the halls of the U.S. House, her time in public service has always been focused on advocating for WyomingÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs future.

First elected to the U.S. House in 2008, Senator Lummis quickly earned her reputation as a no-nonsense conservative and principled policymaker. She was a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group consisting of the most unflinching conservative Members of the House of Representatives. She fought throughout her tenure in Congress to rein in spending and reduce the federal deficit, working with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and ultimately co-sponsoring several bipartisan budget proposals.

In the House of Representatives, Senator Lummis effectively elevated western issues, pushing through the first Interior and Environment (EPA) Appropriations bill to pass the House in seven years under her chairmanship. This marked a significant milestone for the Western Caucus and the rural communities across the West they represent. She also worked to keep public lands open to the public and available for multiple use. She successfully passed the National Forest System Trails Stewardship Act in 2016, a bipartisan effort led by Cynthia to maintain over 157,000 miles of trails within our national forests.

Senator Lummis is a dedicated champion of WyomingÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs mineral and energy resources. In Washington, she fought off attacks from the environmental left while advocating for market opportunities both at home and abroad. She is the proud godmother of the ANSAC Wyoming, a commercial shipping vessel transporting trona from the U.S. to Southeast Asia and is the recipient of the lifetime achievement award from the Washington Coal Club.

Prior to serving in the House of Representatives, Senator Lummis spent eight years as Wyoming State Treasurer and 14 years as a member of the Wyoming State House and Senate. She also worked as general counsel to Wyoming Governor Jim Geringer and Director of the Office of State Lands and Investments, as well as a law clerk at the Wyoming Supreme Court.

After departing U.S. House of Representatives in 2016, Senator Lummis operated her familyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs cattle ranches and the Sweetgrass development in Laramie County, with her brother and sister. She is a three-time graduate of the University of Wyoming in animal science, biology and law.

SN002,"Wyden, Ron",Oregon,Democratic,III,SD-221,Wyden,https://www.wyden.senate.gov/meet-ron,"Commitment to Open Government, Bipartisanship and Innovation
Oregonians know Ron as a senator who listens and innovates. For example, Ron has secured landmark health care and economic wins for our workers and retirees. Always citing the need to ""throw open the doors of government for Oregonians,"" he holds an open-to-all town hall meeting in each of Oregon's 36 counties each year. Thus far he has held more than 1080 meetings, as well as several virtual town hall meetings sponsored by the nonpartisan Town Hall Project. Wyden's dedication to hearing all sides of an issue and looking for common sense, nonpartisan solutions has won him trust on both sides of the aisle and put him at the heart of so many of the Senate's most important debates. In 2011, the Almanac of American Politics described Wyden as having ""displayed a genius for coming up with sensible-sounding ideas no one else had thought of and making the counter-intuitive political alliances that prove helpful in passing bills."" The Washington Post's Ezra Klein wrote: ""The country has problems. And Ron Wyden has comprehensive, bipartisan proposals for fixing them.""

In advocating for the needs of working families, Ron wants a tax code that gives small businesses and families an opportunity to get ahead, not one that rigs the rules for multinational corporations or the mega-rich. He led a pioneering expansion of unemployment benefits to help workers shoulder the economic burden of the COVID-19 health crisis, which economists say added more than $200 billion to the economy at a time when it was desperately needed. He updated the ""Medicare Guarantee"" with improved services for seniors with chronic illnesses, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, he secured Medicare coverage for telemedicine so homebound seniors could safely access medical care. Ron advanced the Family First Act to improve care for vulnerable families and kids, and was the first to promote internet policies that ensure free opportunities for Americans to learn and find good-paying jobs. Ron was also the first to introduce federal legislation to give all Americans the opportunity to vote by mail. 

Moreover, when principles are at stake, however, Ron Wyden never shies away from standing alone, even when it means taking on powerful interest groups or his own party.  His lone stand against the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) and its predecessor, the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeit Act (COICA), put a spotlight on the problematic legislation being fast tracked through Congress and served as a rallying point for the historic Internet protests that ultimately toppled the bills.  He stood alone on the floor of the Senate to block right wing efforts to overturn Oregon's Death with Dignity law; a law that Oregon voters have passed twice. He went head-to-head with the E.P.A. to reduce cancer-causing benzene in gasoline sold in Oregon, and key elements of Wyden's Kinship Care Act were included as part of major reforms improving the nation's foster care system. Wyden's provisions recognized and strengthened support for kinship care, the full-time care and protection of children by relatives.

His relentless defiance of the national security community's abuse of secrecy forced the declassification of the CIA Inspector General's 9/11 report, shut down the controversial Total Information Awareness program and put a spotlight on both the Bush and Obama Administration's reliance on ""secret law."" 

Wyden has taken the lead on policies that are helping to grow the economy in areas like improved infrastructure through his Build America Bonds program, micro and nano-technology, e-commerce, and through incentives for cleaner sources of energy.

He has won countless awards for his pioneering role in establishing a free and open Internet, is known for his commitment to an open government, having authored the ""Stand By Your Ad"" law and the resolution ending Senate Secret Holds, and he has been routinely recognized as one of the Senate's foremost health policy thinkers.  

Commitment to Oregon Values & Priorities
In Oregon, Wyden has authored laws extending permanent Wilderness protections to more than 400,000 acres including Mt. Hood, the Columbia River Gorge, Oregon's Bull Run Watershed, Badlands, Spring Basin, Copper Salmon and Soda Mountain. He has championed the designation of 1,986 miles of Wild and Scenic rivers in Oregon ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂmore than any other member of Congress, overall, for the contiguous 48 states ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂhelping Oregon secure the most wild and scenic river designations in the lower 48 states. Since 2000, the Wyden-authored Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act, commonly known as the ""county payments"" law, has helped provide a stable source of revenue for historically timber-dependent communities and Wyden's Combat Illegal Logging Act has helped protect Oregon's hardwood industries from the import of illegally harvested timber products. Wyden has fought to expand rural access to health care. For example, Wyden secured the creation of a Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic in La Grande for veterans in Eastern Oregon.

Wyden serves on the Committees on Finance, Budget, Intelligence, and Energy and Natural Resources.  He is Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee and a senior member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

Wyden began college at the University of California-Santa Barbara where he won a basketball scholarship and played in Division I competition for two seasons before transferring to Stanford University where he completed his Bachelors degree with distinction.  He earned his law degree from the University of Oregon School of Law in 1974, after which he taught gerontology and co-founded the Oregon chapter of the Gray Panthers, an advocacy group for the elderly.  He also served as the director of Oregon Legal Services for the Elderly from 1977 to 1979 and was a member of the Oregon State Board of Examiners of Nursing Home Administrators during that same period. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1981 until his election to the U.S. Senate.

A frequent visitor to American troops stationed overseas for on-the-ground assessments, Graham has consistently pushed for outcomes in the War on Terror that protect our long-term national security interests. One leading conservative wrote that when it comes to defending America, ""[Lindsey] Graham has been right about more things on foreign policy for longer than just about anyoneÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂif anyone has bragging rights on foreign policy, it is Graham.""

Graham is also a leader in cutting spending, reforming entitlements, and getting government out of the way so businesses can create jobs.

Senator Hassan was drawn to public service as an advocate fighting to ensure that children like her son Ben, who experiences severe disabilities, would be fully included in their communities and have the same opportunities that all parents want for their children.

In 1999, then-Governor Shaheen asked her to serve on the Advisory Committee to the Adequacy in Education and Finance Commission. Her experience as a business attorney and as a parent of a child who experiences disabilities enabled her to provide a unique perspective as the commission did its work. Senator Hassan was first elected to the New Hampshire Senate in 2004, serving the people of the 23rd District, which included ten Seacoast towns. 

In 2013, she was sworn in as the 81st Governor of New Hampshire.

SN014,"Smith, Tina",Minnesota,Democratic,II,SH-720,Smith,https://www.smith.senate.gov/about-tina/biography/,"Tina was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1958 and lived in a handful of states before attending Stanford University. To earn money for college, at age 19 she worked on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, where she was a labor union member. After college, she went to the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College where she met her husband Archie in line at the First Year BBQ. In 1984, excited by the possibility of starting their careers, Tina and Archie moved to what would become their permanent home: Minnesota.

Tina first worked at General Mills in Minnesota before starting her own small business and later worked as an executive at Planned Parenthood. As someone who believes that politics should be about improving peopleÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs lives, it didnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt take long for her to become active in her community. She started by getting involved in local campaignsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂfirst by taking her two young children in a stroller to talk with voters in apartment complexes, who were often ignoredÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂand then went on to manage multiple political campaigns. Tina served as chief of staff to Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak and following that, joined Mark DaytonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs campaign for governor. When he took office in 2011, there was only one person he imagined as his chief of staff: Tina Smith.

It wasnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt until 2014 that Tina would run for office for the first time as Governor DaytonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs running mate. Tina became MinnesotaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 48 th Lieutenant Governor in 2015 and was appointed to the U.S. Senate in 2017. She won back-to-back election victories, securing her first 6-year term in November 2020.

Tina believes the best ideas come from those closest to the issues, which is why she has made it a priority to travel across the state to listen to Minnesotans and transform what sheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs learned into laws that will help them. Her collaborative approach to leadership has led her to pass over 70 bills and provisions into law that have benefited working families, farmers, veterans, businesses and Tribal communities. Her bipartisan record sets her apart as a leader with a knack for finding solutions to problems that members from both parties can get behind. This work has made health care more affordable and accessible, expanded broadband service across the state and boosted the efforts of schools and teachers to prepare students for in-demand careers.

She also has been a progressive leader fighting for racial justice, womenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs reproductive rights and a clean energy future.

Her work has led to the establishment of Juneteenth as a national holiday, to giving back over 11 thousand acres of land to the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe and to providing a path to citizenship for MinnesotaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Liberian community. As the only U.S. Senator to have worked for Planned Parenthood, she has been a key leader in the fight to protect womenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs right to choose. Additionally, as the country faces the climate crisis, she has risen as a leader in the push for a clean energy future.

Tina currently serves on four Senate committees: Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs; Finance; and Indian Affairs. She is the ranking member of two Senate subcommittees: Housing, Transportation, and Community Development; and Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Growth.

The decision to move to Minnesota became the foundation for a life rooted in community and public service. Nearly four decades after moving to the state, serving Minnesotans as their U.S. Senator may have been unexpected, but itÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs a job she loves.

Tina and Archie have two sons, three grandsons, one granddaugther, and a lively chocolate lab named Moose. Sam is married to Emily and they have a son named Harlan and a daughter named June; Mason is married to Julia and they have two sons, named Ari and Simon. In her free time, she enjoys hiking and birdwatching in the summer and skiing and ice fishing in the winter.

She is fighting for all Nevadans by being an independent voice who brings people together to find commonsense, bipartisan solutions for our state.



Senator Jacky Rosen works across the aisle to solve problems and achieve results for Nevada. Elected to the U.S. House in 2016 and then the U.S. Senate in 2018, Jacky is the second woman ever to serve Nevada in the U.S. Senate, alongside fellow Senator Catherine Cortez Masto.

Focused on Bipartisanship

Jacky has been ranked by independent experts as one of the most bipartisan Senators in the chamber. More than 90% of the legislation she has introduced in the Senate is bipartisan, and her commitment to building relationships and working across the aisle has earned her a reputation for making ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRepublican friends as a way to get things done.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

In 2021, Jacky helped write and pass the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law as part of the bipartisan group of Senators who negotiated the final landmark package. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is now delivering thousands of good-paying jobs to our state while fixing NevadaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs roads and highways, modernizing our airports, and making high-speed internet faster and more affordable.

Building Economic Opportunity
In the Senate, Jacky is working to improve the lives of all Nevadans and fighting for an economy that gives everyone the opportunity to succeed. As Chair of the Subcommittee on Tourism, Trade, and Export Promotion, Jacky has led bipartisan efforts to restore NevadaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs tourism and hospitality industry, provide resources to small businesses and entrepreneurs, bolster our stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs booming clean energy economy, break down barriers for legally operating cannabis businesses, and build up Nevada as an incubator of innovative new technologies and cutting-edge research. She is an ally of NevadaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs labor community, believes in the right of workers to join a union, and supports pro-worker policies like affordable child care, paid family leave, and equal pay for equal work. And with rising prices stretching familiesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ budgets to the breaking point, Jacky is pushing to increase access to affordable housing in Nevada, cut taxes for the middle class, and lower costs for everyday essentials.

When it comes to education, Jacky has passed funding to rebuild NevadaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs crumbling and outdated K-12 public schools, fought for better pay for our teachers, and pushed for increased mental health resources for our students. She has introduced legislation to expand and improve key workforce development programs and skills training initiatives to prepare Nevadans for the careers of the 21st century.

As the only former computer programmer in the U.S. Senate, Jacky has been a champion for strengthening our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs cybersecurity and improving science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education, including through her bipartisan Building Blocks of STEM Act, which was signed into law. Jacky is the co-founder and co-chair of the first ever bipartisan Women in STEM Caucus in the Senate.

Jacky knows that health care is the key that makes other opportunities possible. ThatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs why she is working to bring down the rising cost of health care and prescription drugs, tackle NevadaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs doctor shortage, and increase access to telemedicine and rural health care. As Chair of the SenateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs bipartisan Comprehensive Care Caucus, she is fighting to support family caregivers and will always stand strong to protect Medicare and Social Security for our seniors.






Fighting for Nevada


Jacky is laser-focused on putting Nevada first and prioritizing the issues that matter to our unique state. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, she is a strong advocate for NevadaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs servicemembers, military families, and defense installations ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ playing a key role in shaping and passing the annual national defense bill to enhance AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs national security and support our troops. The proud daughter of a World War II veteran, Jacky is standing up for NevadaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs veterans and expanding access to the benefits our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs heroes have earned. She is also committed to ensuring NevadaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs local law enforcement and first responders have the resources to do their jobs and keep our communities safe from crime.

A longtime proponent of comprehensive immigration reform, Jacky has pushed Congress to finally tackle this issue by providing a pathway to citizenship, strengthening border security while keeping families together, and repairing this severely broken system. As someone who spent most of her life outside of politics, Jacky is working to bring more accountability to the federal government, taking on political corruption, and reforming how Washington works. Like the vast majority of Nevadans, she is a fierce defender of womenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs reproductive health rights, as well as LGBTQ+ rights and voting rights.

As Nevadans know, the effects of climate change have hit our state hard. Jacky has secured critical resources to combat Western drought impacting Lake Mead and Lake Tahoe, and to mitigate the increasing threat of wildfires. She is a staunch defender of keeping NevadaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs public lands in public hands for all to enjoy and increasing conservation efforts to protect our stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs natural beauty. Jacky has been leading the fight against job-killing tariffs on solar energy technology that are hurting domestic projects, raising prices, and stunting our climate goals. She has also stood strong against efforts to revive Yucca Mountain, ensuring Nevada never becomes a dumping ground for the rest of the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs nuclear waste.

Early Days
Growing up in a working class family in the Chicago suburbs, Jacky was the first in her family to graduate from college. To afford higher education and make ends meet, she took out student loans and worked multiple jobs, including waiting tables at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas where she was a proud member of Culinary Workers Union Local 226. Jacky earned her undergraduate bachelorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis in 1979 and later earned her associateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs degree in computing and information technology in 1985 from Clark County Community College, which is now the College of Southern Nevada. After working as a computer programmer at major companies in Southern Nevada, she later stepped away from her career to take care of her aging parents and in-laws as they dealt with increasing health issues.

Before being elected to public office, Jacky served as President of Congregation Ner Tamid, NevadaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs largest synagogue. She holds the distinction of being the third female Jewish Senator in U.S. history, as well as the first former synagogue president to serve in the Senate. An outspoken supporter of Israel and combating antisemitism, she is now the co-founder and co-chair of the Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Antisemitism and the bipartisan Abraham Accords Caucus in the Senate.

Jacky has called Nevada home for more than 40 years.

Pictures of Senator Jeff Merkley.
Jeff is OregonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂroots and bootsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ SenatorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂcalled that because of his deep Oregon roots and?his boots on the ground, traveling to meet with Oregonians in every corner of the state.

Born in the Southern Oregon timber town of Myrtle Creek, Jeff spent his early years in Douglas County, where his father worked as a millwrightÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe mechanic who keeps the mill machinery running. The family moved with the timber economy to Roseburg, and then to East Multnomah County.

JeffÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs parents personally experienced the great American expansion of the middle class in the post-World War II era. Though they both came from humble origins, JeffÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs parents were able to save enough money to buy a modest home, take their children on yearly camping trips, and retire comfortably after a lifetime of contributing to their community.

They also instilled in him from an early age the value of education. When Jeff was young, his father took him to the doors of his school and told him, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂIf you walk through those doors and work hard, you can do just about anything because we are fortunate to live in America.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ That ethos led Jeff to become a top student at his public high school and ultimately put him on the path to higher education. In 1979, he became the first person in his family to graduate from college. 

ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ The Core Place I Come From Is
That Ordinary People Need a Champion. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
Senator Jeff Merkley's signature.
Working For The People
Jeff had gained admission to college based on his strength in math, but when he arrived on campus, he was curious about other subjects and studied a little bit of everything. As he faced a dilemma about what he could do to make the world a better place, someone suggested to him that he spend a summer interning at the Capitol for OregonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs U.S. Senator Mark Hatfield. Captivated by public service, Jeff worked at a restaurant waiting tables and washing dishes to extend his time in D.C.

It was during that formative internship with Hatfield and the following year in D.C. that he saw the huge impact public policy could makeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂa good policy helps millions of people, while a bad policy hurts millions of people.

After Jeff completed his studies, he returned to D.C. to work on some of the biggest policy issues of the time: nuclear disarmament and military spending. He also met his future wife, Mary Sorteberg, while she was working at a homeless shelter in D.C. as part of the Lutheran Volunteer Corps.

As JeffÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs time in D.C. wore on, he felt a pull to return to Oregon. Figuring out what he would do, however, was a struggleÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂas Jeff puts it, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂThere wasnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt a big market for nuclear policy analysts in Oregon.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ But Jeff started volunteering with OregonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Habitat for Humanity and was soon hired as the Executive Director of Portland Area Habitat, and then developed affordable housing for another non-profit.

Pictures of Senator Jeff Merkley and his family.
As Jeff worked to create ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂa decent home in a decent community for every family,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ he began to see that many of the problems their residents were facing couldnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt be solved by non-profits aloneÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂit was going to take action from elected officials. After a frustrating meeting in which he found that many city counselors were more interested in promoting downtown development than addressing affordable housing, he had a realization: maybe he could be more effective if he was on the other side of the table.

In 1998, Jeff ran for the state legislature and was elected to represent the same blue collar neighborhood he grew up in. In the legislature, he fought for families to have an opportunity to thrive, and in 2007, he was elected to serve as Speaker. Under his leadership, the Oregon legislature passed an agenda that included the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first-ever rainy-day fund, expanding access to affordable prescription drugs, protecting LGBTQ+ Oregonians from discrimination, and throwing predatory payday lenders out of the state for good. The following year, he was elected to the very same U.S. Senate seat once held by his first public policy mentorÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂMark Hatfield.

Today, Jeff still lives in the same blue-collar neighborhood in East Multnomah County where he grew up.  But his neighbors today have a lot tougher of a road to a brighter future than he had, because for decades the powerful and privileged have stacked the deck against working Americans.

Jeff roots his work in fighting for the four foundations for working families to thriveÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂhealth care, housing, education, and good-paying jobs. Every day, Jeff takes on the powerfulÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthose who already have wealth and influence and privilegeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂto put power and opportunity back into the hands of the people.

Jeff believes in using ideas and feedback from folks living in every corner of Oregon to shape his work in Washington, D.C. He holds a town hall conversation for each of the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 36 counties every yearÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂover 500 town halls and countingÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂand uses those conversations to deliver for Oregonians. The challenges he hears about from folks in Oregon, from climate chaos to affordable housing, mental health, and child care, shape the bills he writes and the votes he casts.

Hear from Jeff about just some of the progress he made for Oregon in 2024.

Jeff is a member of the Appropriations Committee, where he chairs the Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies; the Environment and Public Works Committee, where he chairs the Subcommittee on Chemical Safety, Waste Management, Environmental Justice, and Regulatory Oversight; the Budget Committee; the Rules Committee; and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He is also the Co-Chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.

John Hickenlooper took an unconventional path to public office. After starting out as a geologist, John took a chance by opening the first brewpub in Colorado. As a small business owner, he gained a deep understanding of the local community and the value of collaboration. John entered public service because he knew he could listen to the diverse array of Colorado voices and get things done. As ColoradoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs U.S. Senator, John is committed to bringing people together to solve our countryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs toughest problems.

Learn how John can help you

Humble Beginnings
John was raised by a strong single mother after he lost his father to cancer when he was just eight years old. He remembers his father teaching him that if you can learn to laugh at something, it can never beat you. John has carried that lesson throughout his life.




Background in Small Business
John started his career in Colorado as a geologist. After being laid off in the long recession of the mid-80ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs, he opened the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs first brewpub in a neglected warehouse district in Lower Downtown (LoDo) Denver. He and his partners started multiple businesses, renovating nearly a full block of LoDo warehouses in mixed-use developments that included 90 units of affordable housing. His company led the renovation efforts of more than a dozen historic buildings in cities across the Midwest.

From Beer to Bureaucracy
In 2003, John was elected Mayor of Denver. As Mayor, he focused on bringing people together to get things done, just as heÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂd done as an entrepreneur. He unified all 34 metro mayors to fund and build FasTracks, the most ambitious U.S. transit initiative in modern American history with 119 miles of new track. John made Denver the first large city to provide quality early childhood education for every 4-year old, initiated the most significant police reforms in the CityÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs history, and opened one of the first offices of sustainability in the country.





Lessons as Governor
John served as Governor of Colorado from 2011 to 2019. During his tenure, ColoradoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs economy recovered from ranking 40th in job creation during the Great Recession to become the number one economy in the country (U.S. News & World Report). As Governor, he expanded health care to half a million Coloradans, established climate pollution limits that served as a national model, and enacted commonsense gun safety measures. He also oversaw the creation of the first regulatory framework in the U.S. for the legalization of recreational marijuana, which has become the gold standard.

The Next Chapter
John is honored to serve the people of Colorado in the U.S. Senate. From traveling the state to sit down with farmers and small business owners to chairing committee hearings in Washington, John serves in the Senate with the appreciation that when he casts a vote, he represents all of Colorado.

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand grew up in Upstate New York in a family committed to public service. Her grandmother worked in the New York State Legislature at a time few women did and was a trailblazing grassroots organizer. As a child, Kirsten would join her grandmother to go door-to-door urging their neighbors to vote. Her father was a public defender and her mother was a lawyer who taught Kirsten about the importance of representing those without a powerful voice of their own. They inspired KirstenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs passion for public service.

A Commitment to Open, Accountable and Transparent Government
After being first elected to the House of Representatives, Kirsten became the first member of Congress ever to post a daily report listing her official meetings, earmark requests, and personal financial disclosures online for public consumption. Additionally, she authored the STOCK Act to ban members of Congress and their families from insider trading and has led reform efforts to ban members of Congress from owning and trading stocks at all.



A Relentless Fighter
In just her first term in the Senate, Kirsten led the effort to repeal the discriminatory ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂDonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt Ask, DonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt TellÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ policy that banned gay people from serving openly in the military and passed the historic 9/11 health bill, which ensured that first responders and 9/11 survivors got the health care they deserved. More recently, she passed major legislation to give benefits to veterans exposed to toxic burn pits overseas, passed the first-ever federal law making domestic gun trafficking a crime, and reformed the military justice system on behalf of service members.

A Champion for New Yorkers
In the Senate, Senator Gillibrand is a senior member of the Armed Services Committee and is ranking member of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. In addition, she is ranking member of the Senate Aging Committee, where she is working to bring down prescription drug costs, protect Social Security and Medicare, guard against financial scams, and make sure that every American can age with dignity.

She dedicates her public service to promoting opportunities for all Tennesseans, including by breaking barriers for women, and making America a more prosperous place to live.

Click here to view Senator Blackburn's full biography.
In 2018, the people of Tennessee elected Marsha Blackburn as the first woman to represent the Volunteer State in the United States Senate. As TennesseeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs senior senator, she serves on the Deputy Whip Team and is a member of the Finance Committee; the Commerce, Science & Transportation Committee; the VeteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Affairs Committee; and the Judiciary Committee. She serves as the Ranking Member on the Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security and the Judiciary Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law. 

Marsha dedicates her public service to promoting opportunities for all Tennesseans, including by breaking barriers for women, and making America a more prosperous place to live. As a longtime ally of the entertainment industry, Marsha began her career in public service in 1995 when she served as executive director of the Tennessee Film, Entertainment, and Music Commission. While serving in the Tennessee State Senate, Marsha led a successful, statewide grassroots campaign to defeat a proposed state income tax, earning her a reputation as an anti-tax champion. Before her election to the U.S. Senate, Marsha represented TennesseeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 7th Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives, where she became a leader in the fight for a small, efficient federal government that is accountable to its citizens. 

In the United States Senate, Marsha has continued to fight for fiscal responsibility, economic opportunity, and strategic trade policies that advance U.S. competitiveness. To rein in reckless spending, she has introduced legislation requiring 1%, 2%, and 5% across-the-board cuts to non-defense, non-veterans, and non-homeland security spending. 

A staunch supporter of the military, Marsha champions policies that support active duty servicemembers and guardsmen, their families, and their missions at home and abroad. In 2022, she successfully led the fight to repeal the militaryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs COVID-19 vaccine mandate. She is a leading advocate for veterans and has fought tirelessly to expand their health care access through the community care program. MarshaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs commitment to protecting quality health care for all Tennesseans motivated the creation of her ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRural Health Agenda,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ an innovative series of bills that would expand access, support providers, and assist local leaders in making care provision a crucial aspect of economic development. In addition, her bipartisan Transparency and Effective Accountability Measures for (TEAM) Veteran Caregivers Act, which improves the VA caregiver program, and Strengthening VA Cybersecurity Act, which protects veteransÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ personal information, were both signed into law.

Throughout her time in Congress, Marsha has led the fight to hold Communist China accountable. Her in-depth analyses of the Chinese Communist PartyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs threats to American sovereignty have prompted Congress to examine legislation countering BeijingÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs malign influence on global supply chains, technology infrastructure, and international organizations. After Beijing took over the once autonomous region of Hong Kong in 2019, Marsha led bipartisan legislation, which was signed into law by President Trump, that prohibits the U.S. export of crowd control equipment to the Hong Kong Police Force. Her bipartisan Open Technology Fund Authorization Act, which supports internet freedom by addressing authoritarian regimesÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ efforts to censor the internet, was also signed into law.

At the same time Marsha has stood up to Communist China, she has worked to bolster the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. In August 2022, she visited Taiwan, met with President Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei, and called to strengthen connections between the U.S. and Taiwan. During this visit, Marsha made her stance clear: Taiwan is a country.

Marsha has championed numerous initiatives on behalf of the creative community including the AM/FM Act and the HITS Act, as well as a tax classification fix for self-employed workers that was implemented as part of the CARES Act. These efforts built on her advocacy on behalf of creators and rights-owners in the House of Representatives, where she established the bipartisan Songwriters Caucus and successfully fought for passage of the Music Modernization Act, which revolutionized music licensing processes, and the BOTS Act, which empowered the Federal Trade Commission to crack down on digital scalpers. 

On border policy, Marsha bases her approach on the simple truth that until our borders are secure, every town will be a border town and every state will be a border state. In the Senate, she has led the charge to fully fund the United States Border Patrol, restart construction of a physical barrier, impose harsher criminal penalties for drug smuggling, and fight for law and order on behalf of the thousands of women and girls lost to cross-border human trafficking. 

Since taking public office, Marsha has been a leader in the fight to protect women and children. Following reports that social media platforms knowingly exposed minors to harmful content, Marsha first introduced the Kids Online Safety Act in the 117th Congress. In 2024, her bipartisan REPORT Act, which requires Big Tech companies to report sex trafficking crimes against children to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, was signed into law.

To protect women from workplace abuse, Marsha introduced the Speak Out Act, which was signed into law in 2022 and prohibits the enforcement of NDAs in instances of sexual harassment and assault. In 2019, her bipartisan WomenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Suffrage Centennial Commemorative Coin Act, honoring the 100th anniversary of women gaining the right to vote and the legacy of the suffrage activists, was signed into law by President Trump.
