The following set of tweets are from American politicians and I want to analyse if the sentiment of the tweets align with the party (which will be labeled 0), if it doesn't align with the party (which will be labeled 1), and if it's irrelevant to party values (e.g. celebration of holiday, to be labeled as 2). I will provide examples of each: Example of not aligning with party values (1 index): republican politician: "victory building workers amp the have reached a tentative agreement that achieves historic wins for the union s membership in what will be the first post pandemic contract between the two sides nlive at for more details" This example is 1 because republicans tend to support free market, thus would be against unionization. This tweets indicates support for unionization, thus doesn't align with republican party values. Example of aligning with party values (0 index): republican politician: "in less than a month joe biden and congressional democrats forced blue collar workers to give 17 500 to college graduates making 75 000 so they can buy a tesla and pay off their student loans " This is an example of 0 because republicans support free market, against government intervention and want to prevent inflation. Biden's proposition to pay off student loans would be a big government intervention and cause large debt accumulation.
